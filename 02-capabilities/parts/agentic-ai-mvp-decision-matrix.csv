AgenticAI Capabilities,Requirements,October 1st MVP Decisions,Alternative Options post MVP,Confidence Rating / Notes
Agent Development framework,"Define how agents are designed, how they interact, and how they achieve their objectives.","• Strands
• LangGraph",,"High - mature OSS"
Agentic hosting / runtime,"Auto-scaling runtimes, scheduler systems, and queue systems for agent execution with Network-level security including private networks and traffic isolation",• AWS AgentCore Runtime,• Kubernetes Containers,"High - Pending General Availability & VPC connectivity"
Agentic builder (CI/CD),"Code integration, testing, and deployment",• .NEF tooling,,"High - Existing tools with the need to support python"
GraphDB (Semantic) / VectorDB,Interconnected web of facts that illustrates the semantic relationships between entities.,"• PostgreSQL with Graph (AGE) / Vector extension",• Neo4j,"Medium - requires efforts to manage knowledge lifecycle via Agents"
Context Memory and State management,"Context management, long-term memory systems, and knowledge stores",• PostgreSQL,• Mem0,"High - Existing database technology"
Agent Registry,"Metadata about each agent, allowing other agents or systems to discover and interact with them",• Databricks - Unity Catalogue,• Build our own,"Medium - originally intended for data governance framework. Evolved to support agents. Requires testing."
MCP Gateway,"Aggregating multiple MCP servers behind a single, secure interface.",• None,• Pending analysis,"Low - No market options but not required until we scale"
MCP Registry / Servers,"Responsible for executing AI logic, handling tool execution, and managing session context between Agents and platform services.","• Use case specific i.e. GitHub, DocMgmt, ServiceNow",• MCP Registry (recent launch from Anthropic),"Medium - undergoing PoC to validate integrations within NAB"
Agent evaluation & observability,"Specialised monitoring for agent performance, evaluation, conversation quality, and behavioral analytics for business and technical owners","• Databricks - MLFlow3
• OpenTelemetry (OTEL)",• Inhouse build using OSS that supports both Business and Tech users,"Medium - Built-in LLM judges with automated metrics with Human Feedback integrations. MLflow 3.4 will have external tool integration to pass additional context"
Large Language Model serving (LLMaaS),Core language models that power agent reasoning and natural language understanding,• Databricks (Mosaic AI Gateway),• AWS Bedrock,"Medium - Requires testing of new frontier models. Limited by geo location and reviews."
Agent Intent and Eventing Communication Backbone,"Decoupling A2A and enabling asynchronous communication with durable messaging.",• NAB Kafka Eventing,,"High - proven technology. Agent testing required"
