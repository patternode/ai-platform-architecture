# Agentic AI Platform Capability Definitions

*Extracted from capability analysis documentation*  
*Date: September 9, 2025*

## Capability Definitions Table

| Capability | Capability Definition |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Autonomous execution** | Ability for agents to operate independently, within the goals set as part of the agentic framework. |
| **Agent Evaluation Framework** | Focuses on measuring the quality, cost, and latency of agentic applications, identifying potential issues, inefficiencies and determining their root causes |
| **Monitoring and Observability** | Tools for tracking agent performance, debugging, and optimising operations |
| **Memory (Short term and long term)** | System's ability to store and recall past experiences to improve decision-making, perception and overall performance. |
| **Identity and Access Management** | Supports impersonation flow where agents can access resources using credentials provided to them or perform actions on behalf of users while maintaining audit trails and access controls. |
| **Integration and Connectivity** | Capacity to connect with diverse data sources, APIs, and enterprise systems through standardised interfaces. |
| **Security and Compliance** | Measures for data protection, encryption, and adherence to regulations. |
| **Agent authoring using BYO Open Source frameworks** | Ability to author agents for specific needs or use cases leveraging open source frameworks |
| **Agent Integration with other Agents authorised using native LangGraph frameworks** | Ability to integrate with other agents and be authorised using native LangGraph frameworks |
