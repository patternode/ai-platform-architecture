# Agentic AI Standards Overview

This section contains standards and guidelines for implementing agentic AI systems within the Patternode architecture.

## Purpose

Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift toward autonomous, goal-oriented AI systems that can reason, plan, and act independently while maintaining alignment with business objectives and safety requirements.

## Scope

These standards cover:

- **Principles**: Core principles for designing agentic systems
- **Patterns**: Reusable architectural patterns for agent-based solutions
- **Frameworks**: Evaluation and selection of agentic AI frameworks
- **Implementation**: Guidelines for building and deploying agentic systems
- **Testing**: Strategies for validating agentic behavior
- **Governance**: Safety, ethics, and control mechanisms

## Structure

- `principles.md` - Fundamental principles for agentic AI systems
