Do comprehensive research on agentic AI platforms and assess how should we should answer the questions in the attached table. Reproduce the table in the report with answers or a range of answers. Provide the rationale in the report for answers and reference sources.
Industry/Domain Context: We are focused on the banking industry.
Platform Scale: We are you considering this for a large enterprise internal platform.
Timeline Constraints: We want time to value to be as fast as possible but am uncomfortable about locking in to a specific platform or consultancy platform choice too early.

We would like to prioritise mainstream agentic AI platforms and frameworks (e.g. AWS AgentCore, Accenture AI Refinery / Distiller, Snowflake Cortex, Microsoft Co-pilot studio and the like)

Focus primarily on a mix of commercial off-the-shelf platforms and open-source frameworks.

Evaluate platform decisions (e.g., modularity, lifecycle updates) in terms of time to value against compliance, risk, or other banking-specific constraints (e.g., data residency, model explainability).
