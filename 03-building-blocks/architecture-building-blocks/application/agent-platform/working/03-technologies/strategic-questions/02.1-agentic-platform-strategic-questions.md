# BNZ Agentic AI Platform Strategy

## Executive Summary

Agentic AI platforms enable autonomous workflows across enterprise systems, promising operational efficiency but raising critical concerns in regulated sectors like banking. While time-to-value is important, banks must prioritize **security, compliance, explainability, and data residency**. This consolidated analysis examines leading platforms (AWS Bedrock AgentCore, Accenture AI Refinery / Distiller, Snowflake Cortex, Microsoft Copilot Studio) and open-source frameworks against six strategic questions, drawing from comprehensive industry research and vendor documentation from 2024–2025.

**Key Finding:** Banking institutions are implementing sophisticated **dual-track strategies** that balance innovation speed with rigorous risk management. As demonstrated by Itaú Unibanco's pilot of AWS AgentCore for "secure and scalable financial services transformation,"[¹](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIta%C3%BA%20has%20pioneered%20using%20AI%2FML,%E2%80%9C) successful implementations require platform choices that balance agility with governance, particularly given Gartner's warning that nearly half of enterprise agent projects may fail without strong risk controls.[²](https://akka.io/blog/agentic-ai-frameworks#:~:text=Placing%20a%20dose%20of%20reality,value%2C%20or%20poor%20risk%20controls)

## Strategic Questions Overview

This analysis addresses seven critical strategic questions for banking agentic AI platform implementation, classified using Bezos' Door Framework[³⁴] to guide decision timing and reversibility considerations:

| Strategic Question | Door Type | Rationale for Door Type | Urgency | Answer |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| **1. NAB Strategy Alignment.** How should we align with the NAB agentic platform strategy? | One-Way | Parent company strategic alignment decisions create long-term constraints on technology choices, vendor relationships, and operational models | High | NAB have a preference for build / open-source on the spectrum of buy versus build. Recognising our scaling constraints is our ambition, we have a preference for "buy + build" i.e. buy maturity acceleration via key partnerships (Accenture + AI Refinery) while also maintaining a "build" position in alignment with NAB agentic framework and platform choices (e.g. LangGraph etc / AgentCore etc). |
| | | | | **Accenture Questions** |
| **2. Target Users.** Who will be the target user for the agentic platform i.e. core developer or high code (HC), no code (NC) or low code (LC)? | Two-Way | User democratization strategies can be adjusted iteratively; business vs. technical user balance evolves with organizational maturity | Medium | Progressive democratization strategy starting with technical teams (developers, data scientists) and expanding to business users through curated low-code interfaces. Begin with developer-focused tools, add visual builders later. |
| **3. ISV Agent Reusability.** How much flexibility is desired for the reuse of ISV developed agents? | One-Way | Platform architecture decisions fundamentally determine future flexibility; difficult to change vendor ecosystem approach once established | High | High flexibility with governance guardrails. Choose platforms supporting open standards (MCP, LangGraph, A2A) with vendor-agnostic agent deployment capabilities. Prioritize interoperability over vendor lock-in. |
| **4. Operations Strategy.** What is the long-term strategy for platform (agent development, deployment) i.e. self managed or fully managed by consultancy partners? | Two-Way | Can transition from vendor-managed to self-managed over time; operational models can evolve based on experience and scale | Medium | Hybrid approach with progressive internalization. Start with vendor-managed implementation (Accenture AI Refinery) and transition to self-managed operations as internal capabilities mature over 18-24 months. |
| **5. Platform Modularity.** What is the ideal desired platform modularity within infrastructure, models, knowledge layer, agent and observability / governance? | One-Way | Core architectural decisions about modularity are difficult to reverse; monolithic vs. modular and agentic vs microservices choices have long-term lock-in implications | High | Microservices architecture with clear separation between infrastructure, models, knowledge layer, agents, and governance. Enable independent scaling and vendor flexibility at each layer. Knowledge layer must align / complement our digital, data & analytics ambition. Infrastructure and observability must align with our existing standards. |
| **6. Update Cadence.** How often will we consider component choices within the platform and what is the process to update modules / services within the platform? | Two-Way | Governance processes and update frequencies can be refined based on operational experience and regulatory feedback | Low | Quarterly technology reviews with monthly operational updates. Implement continuous deployment for non-critical updates, quarterly reviews for architectural changes, annual strategic technology assessments. |
| **7. Decision Timing.** Which platform / module / service decisions are we be comfortable making now vs later? | One-Way | Foundation infrastructure and vendor choices create path dependencies; delayed decisions compound complexity and limit future options | High | Immediate decisions: Core platform architecture, primary vendor partnerships, security frameworks, agentic frameworks. Deferred decisions: Specific agent implementations, advanced features, secondary integrations. Focus on foundational choices first. |

**Decision Framework Implications:** Four questions (#1, #3, #5, #7) require immediate, careful consideration as One-Way doors with significant reversal costs. The remaining questions (#2, #4, #6) can be approached iteratively as Two-Way doors, allowing for learning and adjustment over time.

**Consensus Finding:** Banking AI platforms are pursuing a **hybrid technical-business democratization strategy** with a progressive rollout approach, beginning with technical teams and expanding to business users through curated interfaces.

### Primary User Segments

- **AWS AgentCore:** Primarily aimed at **developers and AI engineers**. Supports "any framework including CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex… any foundation model,"[³](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=real,can%20accelerate%20agents%20to%20production) requiring coding expertise through SDKs rather than visual builders.

- **Accenture AI Refinery/Distiller:** **Developer-oriented** with enterprise SDKs. Emphasizes allowing "developers to focus on business workflows without backend complexity."[⁴](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20distiller%20framework%20reflects%20significant,%E2%80%9D)

- **Snowflake Cortex:** Targets **data teams and analysts**. Cortex Agents orchestrate SQL-based and unstructured tools within Snowflake,[⁵](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=Cortex%20Agents%20orchestrate%20across%20both,applications%20grounded%20in%20enterprise%20data) requiring technical skills for semantic model definition.

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** Primarily **low-code/no-code** for citizen developers. Offers visual agent builder that "doesn't require data scientists or developers,"[⁶](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio#:~:text=The%20platform%27s%20low,people%20without%20extensive%20technical%20backgrounds) enabling business users to design flows in GUI environments.

- **Open-Source Frameworks:** **Developer-focused** tools like LangChain, Haystack, or NVIDIA AutoGen requiring programming skills but offering maximum fine-grained control.

### Banking Implementation Strategy

Research indicates a **70-30 split between technical implementation complexity and democratized access capabilities**. Major banks demonstrate this pattern:

- **JPMorgan Chase** maintains nearly 2,000 AI professionals globally, including a 200-person elite research team, while deploying LLM Suite to 200,000+ employees for document summarization and email generation.
- **Bank of America** deploys 17,000 developers using AI coding assistants (achieving 20% efficiency improvements) while achieving 90% workforce adoption of Erica for Employees across 213,000 staff members.

**Organizational structures favor centralized hub models** (50%+ of banks) where central AI teams control strategy and architecture while business units consume AI capabilities through curated interfaces.

## 3. ISV Agent Reusability: Multi-Vendor Ecosystem with Risk Management

**Consensus Finding:** Banks are implementing **sophisticated multi-vendor strategies** that maximize flexibility while maintaining strict governance controls, with varying platform capabilities for third-party agent integration.

### Platform Flexibility Rankings

- **Very High (AWS AgentCore, Accenture):** AWS AgentCore is framework-agnostic, supporting "any framework… and any foundation model."[³] Accenture Distiller offers "seamless" integration with existing agent libraries.[⁷](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=query%20transformation%20for%20agentic%20RAG%2C,operations%2C%20scalability%2C%20and%20accelerated%20innovation)

- **High (Snowflake with Marketplace):** Building agent ecosystem through "Agentic Native Apps" – pre-built agent modules by third parties that run securely inside Snowflake.[⁸](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-marketplace-adds-agentic-products-and-ai-ready-data-from-leading-news-research-and-market-data-providers/#:~:text=Agentic%20Native%20Apps%20are%20interoperable,monetize%20their%20Agentic%20Native%20Apps) Providers can "build, share, and monetize their Agentic Native Apps" without data movement.

- **Moderate (Copilot Studio):** Less focused on importing external agent code, primarily using Microsoft's templates and plugins. External ISV agents require rewriting logic into Copilot's visual canvas.

- **Maximum (Open Source):** By definition, allows unlimited flexibility for importing or adapting ISV agent code, subject only to internal IT security vetting.

### Risk Management Framework

Banks are developing comprehensive vendor management strategies including:
- **Multi-cloud deployments** and choreography-based solutions over orchestration-based approaches
- **Microservices architecture** enabling incremental service replacement
- **Contractual safeguards** ensuring data portability rights and performance-based pricing
- **Open source alternatives** with Apache 2.0, GPL, and BSD licensing for strategic flexibility

**Banking Rationale:** Snowflake's model is particularly attractive as ISV agents operate inside the secure data cloud without data exfiltration.[⁸] However, all platforms require governance frameworks around third-party agent validation and compliance.

## 4. Long-Term Operations Strategy: Balanced Approach to Control vs Efficiency

**Consensus Finding:** Banks are adopting **pragmatic hybrid approaches** that balance operational efficiency with regulatory control requirements, with most starting vendor-managed and evolving toward selective self-management for sensitive applications.

### Platform Operations Models

- **AWS AgentCore:** **Fully-managed cloud service**. AWS provides infrastructure and updates, touting "fully-managed services that eliminate infrastructure complexity."[⁹](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Faster%20time%20to%20value) No on-premises option offered.

- **Snowflake Cortex:** **SaaS (fully managed)**. Snowflake runs Cortex services in their cloud; customers write queries and agents without managing servers. Data residency managed through region selection.

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** **Fully managed** as part of Azure/M365. Banks leverage Microsoft's security posture (Azure certifications) out-of-the-box.

- **Accenture AI Refinery/Distiller:** **Flexible deployment model**. Can be deployed "flexibly across public cloud, private cloud, on-premises, and sovereign infrastructure."[¹⁰](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=Leveraging%20NVIDIA%20AI%20Enterprise%20software%2C,specific%20requirements) Banks can retain full control (self-managed) or rely on Accenture partnership.

- **Open-Source Frameworks:** **Self-managed**. Banks responsible for deployment, scaling, security patches, and compliance on their own infrastructure.

### Banking Implementation Patterns

**Regulators often prefer control**, making self-managed or controlled cloud deployments attractive for compliance. However, managed SaaS greatly reduces operational burden. **Itaú's confidence in AWS AgentCore** demonstrates growing acceptance of vendor-managed platforms when security and compliance requirements are met.

**Evolution Strategy:** Many banks start with vendor-managed platforms for speed, then evolve to hybrid/self-managed models for sensitive applications requiring maximum control.

## 5. Platform Modularity: Microservices Architecture for Banking Requirements

**Consensus Finding:** **Modular architecture is essential for banking** to enable component swapping for compliance, performance, and vendor flexibility reasons. Platforms demonstrate varying levels of modularity support.

### Modularity Assessment

- **AWS AgentCore:** **Highly modular**. Splits agentic AI into distinct services: Runtime (serverless infrastructure), Gateway (API/tool connections), Memory (short/long term storage), Identity (agent credentials), Observability (metrics/logs), plus secure Code Interpreter and Browser tools.[¹¹](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Runtime%20Deploy%20agents%20on%20secure%2C,running%20tasks.%20Learn%20more) "Mix and match" approach enables using AgentCore runtime with custom memory systems.

- **Accenture Distiller/AI Refinery:** **Modular framework** covering LLM fine-tuning, multi-agent orchestration, chain-of-thought reasoning, memory synchronization, governance and observability.[¹²](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=The%20distiller%20framework%20encapsulates%20what,platform%20interoperability) Lists **Agents, Knowledge, Models, Governance** as separate architectural pillars.

- **Snowflake Cortex:** **Moderately modular** within Snowflake ecosystem. Separates structured analytics (Cortex Analyst) and unstructured search (Cortex Search) as distinct tools,[⁵] plus knowledge layer via marketplace data and semantic models. However, all modules run inside Snowflake's Data Cloud.

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** **Less modularly exposed**. Unified platform approach with Microsoft managing the full stack. Allows connecting multiple data sources via plugins[¹³](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20standout%20features,sophisticated%20logic%2C%20ensuring%20that%20their) but no separable runtime or memory layers for users.

- **Open-Source Frameworks:** **Maximum modularity**. Complete freedom to choose infrastructure, models, retrieval stores, and observability systems, enabling custom compliance configurations.

### Banking Architecture Requirements

Banks are transitioning from **legacy monolithic systems to modular, AI-first platforms** implementing four-layer AI capability stacks:
1. **Engagement Layer** (customer interfaces)
2. **AI-Powered Decision-Making Layer** (orchestrated multiagent systems)  
3. **Core Technology and Data Layer** (industrial AI/ML and enterprise data sublayers)
4. **Operating Model** (governance structures and control towers)

**Goldman Sachs** exemplifies this with hybrid architecture using large models as orchestrators coordinating specialized worker models, supporting multi-model strategies across OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, Meta LLaMA, and Anthropic Claude.

## 6. Update Cadence and Governance Process: Continuous Iteration with Regulatory Integration

**Consensus Finding:** Banks require **comprehensive MLOps frameworks** combining automated governance, testing procedures, and phased deployment strategies while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Technology Refresh Cycles

- **Quarterly model validation cycles** for high-risk models
- **Regulatory compliance updates** triggered by legislative changes (EU AI Act, Basel III, DORA)
- **Monthly security patch management**
- **Semi-annual feature enhancement releases**

### Governance Framework

Leading institutions implement **multi-committee governance structures**:
- **AI Governance Councils** for strategic oversight and regulatory engagement
- **Model Risk Management Committees** for validation and bias testing  
- **Technology Risk Committees** for infrastructure security and business continuity

**NatWest** demonstrates success, reducing update cycles from 40 weeks to 16 weeks while maintaining regulatory compliance through structured governance.

### Continuous Monitoring

Platforms encourage real-time observability. Snowflake Agents prescribe "Monitor and iterate" phases with continuous governance control refinement.[¹⁴](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=4,while%20maintaining%20security%20and%20compliance) AWS AgentCore integrates with CloudWatch and OpenTelemetry for comprehensive monitoring.[¹⁵](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Monitor%20in%20production)

### Testing and Validation

Comprehensive procedures include:
- **Bias and fairness testing** pre-deployment
- **Performance validation** against historical benchmarks
- **Stress testing** under extreme scenarios
- **A/B testing** with gradual rollouts and champion-challenger model frameworks

## 7. Decision Timing: Strategic Sequencing with Critical Path Dependencies

**Consensus Finding:** Banking AI implementations face a **critical timing paradox** where 85% of AI projects fail to reach production, yet early movers establish significant competitive advantages. Success requires **strategic sequencing** balancing innovation speed with rigorous risk management.

### Decide Now (Strategic Foundations)

- **Deployment Model:** Choose cloud vs on-premises early. Accenture Distiller explicitly supports on-premises/sovereign deployments;[¹⁰] AWS and Snowflake allow regional restrictions for data sovereignty.

- **Vendor/Platform Selection:** Core stack decisions affect available tools. Banks should evaluate initial use cases on one platform and avoid premature multi-platform sprawl.

- **Governance & Security Baseline:** Establish compliance guardrails upfront (model approval process, data access controls, audit logging). Microsoft Copilot Studio embeds Azure's enterprise security measures.[¹⁶](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/geo-data-residency-security#:~:text=Azure%20data%20security%20measures)

- **Core Integrations:** Build identity and data connectivity infrastructure. Ensure agents have controlled API access through AWS Identity for agents[¹⁷](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Identity%20Secure%2C%20scalable%20agent%20identity,authorized%20user%20consent.%20Learn%20more) or Snowflake roles.[¹⁸](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=1,role%20to%20a%20custom%20role)

### Decide Later (Evolving Components)

- **Specific LLM Models and Versions:** Models evolve rapidly; maintain flexibility to upgrade or switch providers.
- **Advanced Agent Implementations:** Start with core chatbot/analysis agents; defer specialized capabilities.
- **Extended Capabilities:** Features like NVIDIA's physical AI SDK for video/camera inputs[¹⁹](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20Accenture%20is%20introducing,in%20manufacturing%20and%20warehouse%20automation) can wait until core systems are stable.

### Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Foundation Phase (0-6 months):** Data Infrastructure → Security Framework → Compliance Foundation
2. **Capability Phase (6-18 months):** Use Case Selection → Pilot Development → MVP Testing  
3. **Scaling Phase (18-36 months):** Pilot Results Analysis → Scaling Decision → Resource Allocation

**Early decision priorities** include infrastructure foundations, data governance frameworks, core security/compliance frameworks, and AI talent acquisition (addressing skills shortages with 57% of CROs identifying talent as top risk factor).

## BNZ Scale Analysis: Strategic Implications for Platform Approach

**Critical Finding:** BNZ's scale relative to the reference banks in this study strongly supports a **consultancy partnership model** over a pure DIY approach, particularly for agentic AI platform implementation.

**Phase 3: Hybrid Optimization (36+ months)**
- Balance internal capabilities with strategic partnerships
- Selective build decisions for banking-specific, competitive-advantage use cases
- Maintain partnerships for infrastructure, platforms, and emerging technologies
- Focus internal efforts on customer experience and banking domain expertise

### Learning from Comparable-Scale Banks

**High AI Maturity Benchmarks for Regional Banks:**
- **Capital One (#2 AI Ranking, 5.7x BNZ scale)**: Demonstrates that mid-tier banks can achieve AI leadership through data science-first culture and significant technology investment
- **DBS (#16 AI Ranking, 6.7x BNZ scale)**: Asia's leading digital bank with 350+ AI use cases and $1B annual technology budget, proving regional focus can drive global AI recognition
- **CommBank (#5 AI Ranking, 9.5x BNZ scale)**: Australia's AI leader with A$1.5B annual tech investment, showing that systematic AI integration drives competitive advantage

**Wells Fargo Model Alignment:** Wells Fargo's partnership-heavy approach (#4 AI ranking, 23x BNZ scale) with selective internal development provides the most relevant template for BNZ, given:
- Similar risk-conservative culture in regulated environment
- Focus on proven vendor solutions for platform capabilities
- Internal development concentrated on customer-facing applications
- Emphasis on integration over innovation for foundational technologies

**Australian Banking Context:**
- **ANZ (#33) and NAB (#34)** rank significantly lower than global peers, indicating AI maturity challenges in the Australian banking sector
- This creates **opportunity for BNZ** to leapfrog parent company capabilities through strategic partnership approach
- Regional banks achieving high AI maturity (DBS #16, CommBank #5) demonstrate viable path for BNZ

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Vendor diversification:** Avoid single-vendor dependency through multi-partnership approach
- **Exit strategy planning:** Ensure data portability and component modularity
- **Skills development:** Build internal AI literacy without requiring full platform development capability
- **Governance leadership:** Maintain strategic control while leveraging partner execution

## Strategic Recommendations Summary

| Question | Consensus Recommendation | Key Considerations |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **1. Target Users** | **Progressive democratization**: Start with technical teams building foundational capabilities, expand to business users through curated low-code interfaces | Balance innovation speed with compliance needs; invest in training programs (JPMorgan allocates $300M annually) |
| **2. ISV Agent Flexibility** | **High flexibility with strong governance**: Prioritize platforms supporting multiple frameworks (AWS, Accenture) or secure marketplaces (Snowflake) | Implement comprehensive vendor risk management; prefer solutions enabling data-local execution |
| **3. Operations Strategy** | **Hybrid evolution**: Start vendor-managed for speed, evolve to selective self-management for sensitive applications | Balance operational efficiency with regulatory control; validate vendor security postures |
| **4. Platform Modularity** | **Highly modular architecture**: Choose platforms enabling component separation (AWS, Accenture preferred) | Essential for compliance flexibility; enables gradual technology evolution and vendor risk mitigation |
| **5. Update Cadence** | **Continuous iteration with governance integration**: Quarterly model validation, monthly security updates, automated monitoring | Implement multi-committee governance; reduce update cycles while maintaining compliance |
| **6. Decision Timing** | **Foundation decisions now, implementation details later**: Establish infrastructure, governance, and vendor strategy immediately | Core architecture and risk controls are immediate priorities; specific implementations can evolve |

## Conclusion

The banking industry's approach to agentic AI platform implementation reveals **sophisticated strategies balancing innovation with risk management**. Success requires early commitment to foundational capabilities—governance, data infrastructure, and talent acquisition—while maintaining flexibility in implementation details.

**BNZ's scale analysis strongly supports a partnership-led approach**: At US$82 billion in assets, BNZ is 49x smaller than JPMorgan Chase and lacks the resource scale for pure DIY development. The consultancy partnership model (exemplified by Wells Fargo's #4 AI ranking approach) provides optimal risk-adjusted returns for regional-scale banks, enabling access to global AI expertise while maintaining strategic control.

**AI maturity benchmarking reveals critical insights**: Regional banks like DBS (#16) and CommBank (#5) achieve high AI rankings through focused investment and strategic specialization, while Australian banks ANZ (#33) and NAB (#34) lag significantly behind global peers. This presents BNZ with an opportunity to leapfrog regional competitors through strategic AI platform partnerships, potentially achieving AI maturity levels comparable to successful mid-tier banks like Capital One (#2) and DBS (#16).

**Accenture Partnership Potential**: While specific client relationships are confidential, Accenture's AI Refinery and Distiller framework is designed for banks seeking to accelerate AI adoption without building internal capabilities. Banks ranked in the middle tiers of AI maturity (#15-35 range) represent the optimal target market for Accenture's partnership model, as they have sufficient scale to justify enterprise AI investment but lack the resources for pure DIY approaches.

**Strategic timing emerges as the critical differentiator**: infrastructure and governance decisions cannot be deferred, while technology stack details can evolve with learning. Banks must balance the urgency of competitive positioning against the precision requirements of regulated financial services.

The **15% of projects reaching production** demonstrate clear patterns: business focus over technology fascination, robust risk management integration, strategic partnership utilization, and measured scaling based on validated results. For BNZ, mastering the partnership balance—leveraging Accenture's global expertise while building internal governance and vendor management capabilities—provides the most viable path to sustainable competitive advantage in an increasingly AI-driven financial landscape.

**Accenture's strategic positioning** as a banking AI partner is reinforced by their $3 billion investment in AI capabilities and 40,000+ AI professionals,[³⁵] representing one of the largest consulting-focused AI practices globally. This scale enables comprehensive support for regional banks like BNZ while maintaining the banking domain expertise necessary for regulatory compliance and risk management in financial services.
