# Banking Agentic AI Platform Strategy
## Strategic Decision Framework for BNZ

**Presentation Structure Following Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle**

---

## Slide 1: Executive Recommendation
### SLIDE CONTENT:
**BNZ should pursue an Accenture AI Refinery partnership for agentic AI platform implementation**

**Three Supporting Arguments:**
1. **Scale Analysis**: BNZ lacks resources for DIY approach (49x smaller than JPMorgan Chase)
2. **AI Maturity Gap**: Partnership enables leapfrog opportunity (unranked → potential #15-20 range)
3. **Strategic Timing**: Three critical decisions require immediate action as "One-Way Doors"

### SPEAKER NOTES:
Reference: Executive Summary and Conclusion sections of 05-agentic-platform-strategic-questions-consensus.md

This recommendation follows pyramid principle starting with the conclusion. The scale analysis shows BNZ at US$82B assets is dramatically smaller than global leaders like JPMorgan (US$4.0T) and Bank of America (US$3.3T). Our AI maturity benchmarking using the Evident AI Banking Index reveals BNZ is unranked while regional comparables like DBS (#16) and CommBank (#5) achieved high rankings through strategic partnerships. The strategic timing analysis using Bezos' Door Framework identifies three irreversible decisions requiring immediate attention.

## Slide 2: Critical Business Context
### SLIDE CONTENT:
**Banking AI Landscape Demands Strategic Response**

- **85% of enterprise AI projects fail** without strong risk controls
- **Regional banks achieving AI leadership** through focused partnerships (DBS #16, CommBank #5)
- **Australian banks lagging globally** (ANZ #33, NAB #34) - competitive opportunity for BNZ
- **Agentic AI platforms enable autonomous workflows** but require careful platform choices

### SPEAKER NOTES:
Reference: Executive Summary and BNZ Scale Analysis sections

Gartner warns that nearly half of enterprise agent projects fail without strong risk controls, emphasizing the importance of strategic platform decisions. The Evident AI Banking Index shows successful regional banks like DBS (Singapore) and CommBank (Australia) achieving top rankings through strategic investment and partnerships. Notably, Australian banks ANZ and NAB rank significantly lower (#33, #34), creating a competitive leapfrog opportunity for BNZ. This context establishes the urgency for making the right platform choice now.

## Slide 3: Scale Reality Check
### SLIDE CONTENT:
**BNZ Scale Strongly Favors Partnership Approach**

| Bank | AI Maturity Rank | Total Assets | Scale vs BNZ | Strategic Approach |
|------|------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| JPMorgan Chase | #1 | $4.0T | **49x larger** | Build-Dominant |
| Capital One | #2 | $470B | **5.7x larger** | AI-Native Build |
| CommBank | #5 | $775B | **9.5x larger** | Innovation-Led |
| DBS | #16 | $550B | **6.7x larger** | AI-First Regional |
| ANZ | #33 | $675B | **8.2x larger** | Partnership-Focused |
| NAB (Parent) | #34 | $707B | **8.6x larger** | Regional-Partnership |
| **BNZ** | **Unranked** | **$82B** | **Baseline** | **Partnership-Optimal** |

### SPEAKER NOTES:
Reference: BNZ Scale Analysis section, particularly the Scale Comparison Analysis table

This data from the Evident AI Banking Index reveals BNZ's position relative to global leaders. Even successful regional banks like DBS and CommBank are 6-9x larger than BNZ. The pattern shows that high AI maturity correlates with either massive scale (JPMorgan) or strategic focus with partnerships (regional leaders). BNZ's position at US$82B assets makes partnership the optimal strategic approach, as demonstrated by similar-scale banks achieving AI leadership through focused partnerships rather than DIY development.

## Slide 4: Strategic Decision Framework
### SLIDE CONTENT:
**Six Strategic Questions Classified by Decision Urgency**

**🚪 ONE-WAY DOORS (Decide Now - High Urgency):**
- **ISV Agent Reusability**: Platform architecture determines future flexibility
- **Platform Modularity**: Core architectural decisions create long-term lock-in
- **Decision Timing**: Foundation choices create path dependencies

**🔄 TWO-WAY DOORS (Decide Later - Iterative):**
- **Target Users**: Democratization strategies can evolve
- **Operations Strategy**: Can transition from vendor-managed to self-managed
- **Update Cadence**: Governance processes can be refined

### SPEAKER NOTES:
Reference: Strategic Questions Overview section, Bezos' Door Framework classification

Using Bezos' Door Framework from Amazon's decision-making philosophy, we've classified the six strategic questions by reversibility. One-way doors require careful upfront consideration because they're difficult or costly to reverse. Platform architecture and vendor ecosystem decisions fall into this category - once established, changing becomes expensive and complex. Two-way doors can be approached iteratively, allowing learning and adjustment over time. This framework helps prioritize where to invest decision-making resources immediately versus where experimentation is acceptable.

## Slide 8: Risk Mitigation Strategy
### SLIDE CONTENT:
**Addressing Partnership Risks Through Strategic Design**

**Vendor Dependency Risks:**
- Multi-vendor approach across different technology layers
- Data portability rights in all contracts
- Open standards where possible

**Capability Development:**
- Build internal AI literacy without requiring platform development
- Maintain strategic control while leveraging partner execution
- Focus on governance leadership and vendor management

**Exit Strategy Planning:**
- Component modularity enables incremental transitions
- Skills development supports future optionality

### SPEAKER NOTES:
Reference: Risk Mitigation Strategy section under Learning from Comparable-Scale Banks

Acknowledging partnership risks is crucial for stakeholder confidence. The modular architecture approach enables vendor diversification - different providers for different layers reduces single-vendor dependency. Data portability rights ensure BNZ retains control of its most valuable asset. Building internal AI literacy without full platform development creates future optionality while managing costs. The governance leadership approach means BNZ maintains strategic decision-making while leveraging Accenture's execution capabilities. This balanced approach follows successful patterns from risk-conscious banks in regulated environments.

## Slide 9: Financial Business Case
### SLIDE CONTENT:
**Partnership ROI vs DIY Investment Requirements**

**DIY Approach (Not Recommended):**
- Est. $50-100M initial investment
- 3-5 years to build capability
- 85% failure rate without proven experience
- Opportunity cost: diverting resources from core banking

**Partnership Approach (Recommended):**
- Operational expense model
- 6-18 months to value
- Access to proven frameworks and expertise
- Focus resources on customer-facing innovation

**ROI Drivers:** Time-to-value, risk reduction, access to global expertise, cost predictability

### SPEAKER NOTES:
Reference: Partnership vs DIY Decision Framework section

The financial case strongly favors partnership for BNZ's scale. DIY approaches require massive upfront investment ($50-100M+) that would represent 10-20% of BNZ's estimated annual technology budget versus 1-2% for larger banks. The 3-5 year development timeline creates significant opportunity costs and competitive risks. The 85% failure rate for internal AI projects without external expertise adds substantial risk. Partnership provides cost predictability through operational expense models, faster time-to-value, and allows BNZ to focus limited resources on customer-facing differentiation rather than platform infrastructure development.

## Slide 10: Competitive Implications
### SLIDE CONTENT:
**Leapfrog Opportunity in Australian/NZ Banking**

**Current AI Maturity Rankings:**
- ANZ: #33 globally
- NAB: #34 globally
- BNZ: Unranked

**Partnership enables BNZ to potentially achieve #15-20 range**

**Competitive Advantages:**
- First-mover advantage in NZ market
- Leapfrog Australian parent companies
- Benchmark against global regional leaders (DBS #16)

### SPEAKER NOTES:
Reference: AI Maturity Insights section and Australian Banking Context

The competitive landscape creates a significant opportunity for BNZ. With ANZ and NAB both ranking in the bottom third globally (#33, #34), BNZ can potentially leapfrog its larger competitors through strategic partnerships. The Evident AI Banking Index shows this is achievable - regional banks like DBS (#16) demonstrate that focused investment and partnerships can achieve global AI leadership. BNZ's smaller scale actually becomes an advantage here - faster decision-making, less legacy complexity, and the ability to implement modern approaches without extensive transformation of existing systems.
