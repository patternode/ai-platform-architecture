# Agentic Platform Strategic Questions

## Overview
This document captures key strategic questions that need to be addressed as part of the agentic AI platform strategy and design process. These questions are critical for defining the platform architecture, governance model, and operational approach.

## Strategic Questions

| # | Question | Interpretation (Description) | Answer |
|---|----------|------------------------------|---------|
| 1 | Who will be the target user for the agentic platform i.e. core developer, no code (NC) or low code (LC) | This question addresses the primary persona and skill level of platform users, which will significantly impact platform complexity, user interface design, documentation needs, and support model requirements. | *To be determined* |
| 2 | How much flexibility is desired for the reuse of ISV developed agents | This question explores the balance between time to value versus vendor lock-in, standardisation and customisation, including integration standards for third-party agent components, configuration vs customisation capabilities, licensing implications, and technical compatibility requirements. | *To be determined* |
| 3 | What is the long-term strategy for platform (agent development, deployment) i.e. self managed or fully managed by consultancy partners? | This addresses fundamental operational and governance decisions including build vs buy vs partner strategic approach, internal capability development requirements, vendor dependency and risk management, and long-term cost implications. | *To be determined* |
| 4 | What is the ideal desired platform modularity within infrastructure, models, knowledge layer, agent & observability/governance | This question defines the technical architecture approach including component separation and integration patterns, scalability and flexibility requirements, technology stack decisions, and observability and monitoring architecture. | *To be determined* |
| 5 | How often should we consider component choices within the platform and what is the process to update modules/services within the platform | This addresses platform lifecycle management including technology refresh cycles and processes, change management and impact assessment, testing and validation procedures, and rollback and risk mitigation strategies. | *To be determined* |
| 6 | Which platform / module / service decisions should we be comfortable making now vs later | This question prioritises immediate vs future decisions including critical path dependencies for platform development, risk tolerance for early vs delayed decisions, resource allocation and timeline planning, and minimum viable platform (MVP) scope definition. | *To be determined* |

## Strategic Implications

These questions collectively address several key dimensions of the agentic platform strategy:

- **User Experience**: Questions 1 and 2 focus on who will use the platform and how
- **Operational Model**: Questions 3 and 5 address how the platform will be managed and evolved
- **Technical Architecture**: Question 4 defines the fundamental technical approach
- **Implementation Planning**: Question 6 addresses sequencing and prioritisation

## Next Steps

The answers to these questions should inform:

1. Platform architecture design decisions
2. Vendor selection and partnership strategies
3. Internal capability development plans
4. Implementation roadmap and milestones
5. Governance framework design
6. Risk management and mitigation strategies
