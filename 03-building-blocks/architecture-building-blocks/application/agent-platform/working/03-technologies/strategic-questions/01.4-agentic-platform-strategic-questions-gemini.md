# Agentic AI Platforms for Banking: Strategic Evaluation

Agentic AI platforms enable autonomous workflows across enterprise systems, promising new efficiency but raising concerns in regulated sectors like banking. Time-to-value is important, but banks must prioritize **security, compliance, explainability, and data residency**. We analyze leading platforms (AWS Bedrock AgentCore, Accenture AI Refinery/Distiller, Snowflake Cortex, Microsoft Copilot Studio) and open-source frameworks against six strategic questions. Our conclusions are grounded in vendor documentation and industry sources from 2024–2025.

**Bank example:** Itaú Unibanco (Brazil) is piloting AWS AgentCore for “secure and scalable financial services transformation,” highlighting its developer tools, flexibility, and compliance support[\[1\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIta%C3%BA%20has%20pioneered%20using%20AI%2FML,%E2%80%9C). However, as Gartner notes, without strong risk controls nearly half of enterprise agent projects may fail[\[2\]](https://akka.io/blog/agentic-ai-frameworks#:~:text=Placing%20a%20dose%20of%20reality,value%2C%20or%20poor%20risk%20controls). Thus, platform choice must balance agility with governance.

## 1\. Target Users (Core Dev vs Low-Code vs No-Code)

- **AWS AgentCore:** Primarily aimed at **developers and AI engineers**. It supports “any framework including CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex… any foundation model”[\[3\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=real,can%20accelerate%20agents%20to%20production), implying users with coding expertise. AWS provides SDKs (e.g. AWS Toolkit, CLI) rather than a visual builder. Itaú’s CTO notes AgentCore “gives developers tools and flexibility to build and manage agents, while ensuring compliance”[\[1\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIta%C3%BA%20has%20pioneered%20using%20AI%2FML,%E2%80%9C), confirming a developer audience.
- **Accenture AI Refinery / Distiller:** Also **developer-oriented**, with SDKs and integration layers. Accenture emphasizes “developers to focus on business workflows without backend complexity”[\[4\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20distiller%20framework%20reflects%20significant,%E2%80%9D). Its Distiller framework is an enterprise-grade code library (often deployed via Accenture services) covering memory, workflows, etc. Use likely by in-house AI teams or consulting engineers.
- **Snowflake Cortex:** Targets **data teams and analysts**. Cortex Agents orchestrate SQL-based (Cortex Analyst) and unstructured (Cortex Search) tools within Snowflake[\[5\]](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=Cortex%20Agents%20orchestrate%20across%20both,applications%20grounded%20in%20enterprise%20data). Users will be data engineers or analysts comfortable with SQL and pipelines. The interface is API/SQL-driven rather than low-code, so some technical skill is needed to define “semantic models” and tools.
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** Primarily **low-code/no-code** and citizen developers. It offers a visual agent builder and “doesn’t require data scientists or developers”[\[6\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio#:~:text=The%20platform%27s%20low,people%20without%20extensive%20technical%20backgrounds)[\[7\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio#:~:text=You%20can%20easily%20create%20agents,you%20might%20use%20agents%20include). Business users can connect pre-built or custom data plugins and design flows in a GUI. Copilot Studio is tightly integrated into Microsoft 365 and Teams, so it empowers LOB staff to build chatbots and workflows without heavy coding.
- **Open-Source Frameworks:** Tools like LangChain, Haystack, or NVIDIA AutoGen are **for developers**. They are code libraries or SDKs requiring programming. These frameworks offer fine-grained control but no “no-code” interfaces – target users are ML engineers or software developers building custom agents.

In banking, core developers initially build the system (due to compliance needs), but curated low-code interfaces (especially via Copilot Studio or Snowflake’s UI) may later allow business analysts to adjust workflows.

## 2\. Flexibility for Reusing ISV-Developed Agents

- **High (AWS AgentCore, Accenture):** AWS AgentCore is framework-agnostic, supporting “any framework… and any foundation model”[\[3\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=real,can%20accelerate%20agents%20to%20production). This means third-party (ISV) agents or modules (e.g. built on LangGraph, AutoGen, etc.) can be plugged in. Accenture Distiller similarly offers “seamless” integration with any existing agent library[\[8\]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=query%20transformation%20for%20agentic%20RAG%2C,operations%2C%20scalability%2C%20and%20accelerated%20innovation). Both platforms are designed for extensibility and multi-agent collaboration.
- **High (Snowflake with Marketplace):** Snowflake is building an agent ecosystem. Its **Marketplace** now hosts “Agentic Native Apps” – pre-built agent modules by third parties that run securely inside Snowflake[\[9\]](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-marketplace-adds-agentic-products-and-ai-ready-data-from-leading-news-research-and-market-data-providers/#:~:text=Agentic%20Native%20Apps%20are%20interoperable,monetize%20their%20Agentic%20Native%20Apps). Providers can “build, share, and monetize their Agentic Native Apps” which customers can deploy without moving data[\[9\]](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-marketplace-adds-agentic-products-and-ai-ready-data-from-leading-news-research-and-market-data-providers/#:~:text=Agentic%20Native%20Apps%20are%20interoperable,monetize%20their%20Agentic%20Native%20Apps). This promotes reuse of ISV agents while preserving governance. Snowflake also enables connecting any LLM via AISQL and Knowledge Extensions, giving flexibility.
- **Moderate (Copilot Studio):** Copilot Studio is less about importing external agent code. It focuses on using Microsoft’s templates and plugins. While you can connect to custom APIs or knowledge bases, you generally build your agents within the Copilot framework. Reusing an external ISV agent would require rewriting its logic into Copilot’s visual canvas or via Azure Functions. Thus, flexibility to reuse arbitrary agents is limited compared to open frameworks.
- **Very High (Open Source):** By definition, open-source frameworks allow maximum flexibility. Banks can import or adapt any ISV-provided agent code, or even co-develop with partners. There is no licensing lock; the only constraints are technical. However, using such ISV agents must still satisfy internal IT security vetting.

**Banking rationale:** Flexible reuse (via AWS or Snowflake) speeds delivery but must be vetted for risk. Snowflake’s model is attractive: ISV agents operate inside the secure data cloud (no data exfiltration)[\[9\]](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-marketplace-adds-agentic-products-and-ai-ready-data-from-leading-news-research-and-market-data-providers/#:~:text=Agentic%20Native%20Apps%20are%20interoperable,monetize%20their%20Agentic%20Native%20Apps). AWS and Accenture promise wide compatibility, but banks will need governance around any third-party agent. Low-code options like Copilot likely focus on homegrown workflows, so fewer off-the-shelf agents apply.

## 3\. Long-Term Operations Strategy (Self-Managed vs Managed)

- **AWS AgentCore:** A **fully-managed cloud service**. AWS provides the infrastructure and updates it. Customers simply deploy agents via the console or APIs. AWS touts “fully-managed services that eliminate infrastructure complexity”[\[10\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Faster%20time%20to%20value), accelerating time-to-value. No on-prem option is offered; operation is AWS’s responsibility.
- **Snowflake Cortex:** Also **SaaS (fully managed)**. Snowflake runs the Cortex services in its cloud; customers write queries and agents but do not manage servers. Data residency is managed by choosing Snowflake region. Snowflake handles availability, scaling, and model updates.
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** **Fully managed** as part of Azure/M365. Copilot Studio agents run in Azure; Microsoft controls the underlying service. Banks need Microsoft data centers in acceptable geos, but do not host themselves. The Microsoft security posture (Azure certifications) applies out-of-the-box.
- **Accenture AI Refinery/Distiller:** Typically **delivered by a consultancy**. Distiller is an extensible framework that can run on-prem or in cloud[\[11\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=Leveraging%20NVIDIA%20AI%20Enterprise%20software%2C,specific%20requirements). In practice, Accenture often integrates and operates it as part of its services. A bank could self-deploy (on private or sovereign cloud) or have Accenture manage it. The press release notes Distiller “can be deployed flexibly across public cloud, private cloud, on-premises, and sovereign infrastructure”[\[11\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=Leveraging%20NVIDIA%20AI%20Enterprise%20software%2C,specific%20requirements). This means banks can retain full control (self-managed) or rely on Accenture as a partner.
- **Open-Source Frameworks:** **Self-managed**. Any open-source agent platform (LangChain, etc.) must be hosted on the bank’s own infrastructure (cloud or on-prem). The enterprise is responsible for deployment, scaling, security patches, and compliance. This is more work but offers maximum control.

**Banking context:** Regulators often prefer control. Running services on-prem or in a controlled cloud (as with Distiller or TrueFoundry) may ease compliance (e.g. local data processing). However, managed SaaS (AWS, Snowflake, Microsoft) greatly reduce operational burden. Itaú’s quote underscores confidence: they trust AWS AgentCore to operate “securely and scalably” in production[\[1\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIta%C3%BA%20has%20pioneered%20using%20AI%2FML,%E2%80%9C). In practice, many banks may start with vendor-managed platforms for speed, then evolve to hybrid/self-managed models for sensitive applications.

## 4\. Desired Modularity (Infra, Models, Knowledge, Agents, Observability)

A **modular architecture** (separate infrastructure, model, data, agent, and monitoring layers) is ideal for banking, as it allows swapping components for compliance or performance reasons.

- **AWS AgentCore:** Highly modular. It splits agentic AI into distinct services: **Runtime** (serverless infra for agents), **Gateway** (connects APIs/tools), **Memory** (short/long term memory store), **Identity** (agent credentials), **Observability** (agent metrics/logs), plus tools like secure **Code Interpreter** and **Browser**[\[12\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Runtime%20Deploy%20agents%20on%20secure%2C,running%20tasks.%20Learn%20more). Teams can mix these. For example, they can use AgentCore runtime with their own memory system. AWS even has an “AgentCore toolkit” on GitHub. This “mix and match” approach aligns with banking needs to isolate sensitive data or replace models. Itaú’s CTO praised the modular tools (“developers tools and flexibility… ensuring compliance”)[\[1\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIta%C3%BA%20has%20pioneered%20using%20AI%2FML,%E2%80%9C).
- **Accenture Distiller/AI Refinery:** Also designed modularly. The Distiller framework covers multiple layers: LLM fine-tuning, multi-agent orchestration, chain-of-thought reasoning, memory synchronization, governance and observability[\[13\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=The%20distiller%20framework%20encapsulates%20what,platform%20interoperability). Its “Agent as a Service” sits atop a knowledge layer, models, and integration APIs[\[14\]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=AI%20Refinery,operations%2C%20scalability%2C%20and%20accelerated%20innovation). Accenture’s materials (AI Refinery for Industries) even list **Agents, Knowledge, Models, Governance** as separate pillars[\[15\]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=Agents). Banks can deploy some components (e.g. on-prem knowledge store) and use Accenture-managed others (e.g. model training).
- **Snowflake Cortex:** Moderately modular within Snowflake. It naturally separates **structured analytics** (Cortex Analyst) and **unstructured search** (Cortex Search) as tools for agents[\[5\]](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=Cortex%20Agents%20orchestrate%20across%20both,applications%20grounded%20in%20enterprise%20data). It also supports a knowledge layer via Cortex Knowledge Extensions (marketplace data) and semantic models. However, all modules run inside Snowflake’s Data Cloud. Banks benefit from unified governance, but have less ability to swap out the underlying LLM host (Snowflake uses partners like OpenAI, Anthropic) or change infra. Nevertheless, Snowflake exposes AISQL functions to run LLMs over data in-place, and versioning for semantic models.
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** Less modularly exposed. It runs on Azure with Microsoft managing the stack. Users design agent “topics” and flows with custom or pretrained models (via Azure OpenAI). Copilot does allow connecting multiple data sources via plugins[\[16\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20standout%20features,sophisticated%20logic%2C%20ensuring%20that%20their), and you can swap knowledge bases, but there is no separable “runtime” or “memory” layer for the user. Observability and governance are handled within Microsoft’s tools (Azure Monitor). In practice, it is a single unified platform. This simplicity can speed time-to-value but reduces flexibility to replace components.
- **Open-Source Frameworks:** Most **flexible modularity**. For example, with LangChain or Haystack, you choose your own infrastructure (AWS, on-prem Kubernetes, etc.), pick any model (open or licensed), connect any retrieval or memory store, and integrate with custom observability (Prometheus, etc.). This lets a bank custom-tailor compliance (e.g. deploy only in EU servers, or swap to a new LLM) but requires building each piece.

**Banking takeaway:** Banks should aim for modularity to meet strict requirements. Platforms like AWS and Accenture explicitly support breaking the agent pipeline into layers[\[12\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Runtime%20Deploy%20agents%20on%20secure%2C,running%20tasks.%20Learn%20more)[\[13\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=The%20distiller%20framework%20encapsulates%20what,platform%20interoperability). We recommend choosing solutions that decouple compute, models, knowledge, and control so that sensitive data or models can be contained per regulatory needs. Monolithic systems (like a closed chatbot as a service) may limit auditability and upgrades.

## 5\. Update Cadence and Governance Process

Given fast AI advances and strict compliance, **continuous iteration** is key. Best practice is to treat agentic AI as a living system with a controlled update cycle.

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Platforms encourage real-time observability. For instance, Snowflake Agents explicitly prescribe a “Monitor and iterate” phase: track metrics and user feedback, use tools like TruLens to observe conversations, and _“refine governance controls”_ continuously[\[17\]](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=4,while%20maintaining%20security%20and%20compliance). AWS AgentCore integrates with CloudWatch and OpenTelemetry to monitor token usage, errors, etc[\[18\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Monitor%20in%20production). These features support ongoing tuning of prompts, models, and tools.
- **Frequent Reviews:** New LLMs and frameworks appear quarterly. Banks should re-evaluate model choices on each major release. Moreover, evolving data (market conditions, new regulations) means knowledge layers must be updated regularly. Industry guidance (NIST/ISO) calls for _continuous risk management_ of AI. In fact, global regulators expect “a controlled update process that includes re-validation” for adaptive AI[\[19\]](https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/the-ai-governance-frontier-series-part-1-decoding-global-and-u-s-6a9d0781ba80#:~:text=regularly%20update%20your%20AI%20models,gov). In practice, this means any significant change (new model, new data, or even a major API update) should trigger a validation cycle and perhaps a governance review.
- **Governance Over Time:** AgentCore and Cortex support logging and audit trails (IAM roles, audit logging) to enable model explainability and compliance. Banks should formalize a schedule (e.g. quarterly model-accuracy audits, biannual bias checks) aligned with enterprise model-risk frameworks. Automated tools (e.g. TruLens or AWS Guardrails) can assist. For example, if a model drift or compliance issue is detected, the team would iterate the agent’s prompts or replace the model.
- **Update Process:** Because most platforms are SaaS, infrastructure patches are automatic. The bank’s team focuses on upgrading LLMs and components. They should set a review process: e.g. “at each major release of Copilot Studio or AgentCore, conduct tests before adoption.” For self-hosted parts (open-source or Distiller), operate a CI/CD pipeline. Essentially, expect **ongoing updates** and plan accordingly.

**Banking example:** Regulators like the FDA (and by analogy, banking authorities) look for strict change control. As one source notes in a medical context, _“a controlled update process that includes re-validation will likely be expected”_[\[19\]](https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/the-ai-governance-frontier-series-part-1-decoding-global-and-u-s-6a9d0781ba80#:~:text=regularly%20update%20your%20AI%20models,gov). In banking, this translates to version-locking models, testing new ones in sandbox before promotion, and keeping audit trails. By continuously monitoring agent outputs (Snowflake’s approach)[\[17\]](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=4,while%20maintaining%20security%20and%20compliance), banks can catch issues early and iteratively improve their AI agents.

## 6\. Decisions Now vs Later

**Decide Now (Strategic Foundations):**  
\- **Deployment Model:** Choose cloud vs on-prem early. If data sovereignty is required, select platforms supporting private or sovereign cloud (Accenture Distiller explicitly supports on-prem/sovereign deployments[\[11\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=Leveraging%20NVIDIA%20AI%20Enterprise%20software%2C,specific%20requirements); AWS and Snowflake allow regional restrictions).  
\- **Vendor/Platform Selection:** Pick your core stack now. Locking in AWS, Snowflake, or Azure affects available tools. Banks should evaluate initial use cases on one platform and avoid premature multi-platform sprawl.  
\- **Governance & Security Baseline:** Establish compliance guardrails up front (model approval process, data access controls, audit logging). For example, Microsoft Copilot Studio already embeds Azure’s enterprise security[\[20\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/geo-data-residency-security#:~:text=Azure%20data%20security%20measures); banks should configure these from the start.  
\- **Core Integrations:** Build identity and data connectivity now. Ensure agents have controlled API access (AWS Identity for agents[\[21\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Identity%20Secure%2C%20scalable%20agent%20identity,authorized%20user%20consent.%20Learn%20more) or Snowflake roles[\[22\]](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=1,role%20to%20a%20custom%20role)). Integrate with existing systems early, as it’s harder later.

**Decide Later (Evolving Components):**  
\- **Specific Models:** Wait to choose exact LLM versions until after pilots. New models (GPT-5, Llama3 etc.) emerge rapidly; teams can swap them later.  
\- **Advanced Agents/Features:** Delay adopting complex multi-agent orchestration or custom code execution until basic agents work. For instance, AWS’s code interpreter or browser tools can be phased in.  
\- **Ecosystem Apps:** Banks can revisit third-party agent libraries later, once their platform and security framework is established. For example, Snowflake’s Agentic Marketplace is new; banks may first test with internal data, then integrate marketplace agents.  
\- **Extended Capabilities:** Features like NVIDIA’s physical AI SDK (for video/camera inputs)[\[23\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20Accenture%20is%20introducing,in%20manufacturing%20and%20warehouse%20automation) are niche; a bank can defer such extensions until core chatbot/analysis agents are stable.

In short, **core architecture and risk controls are “now” decisions**, while choosing particular agent implementations or advanced modules can wait. Accenture’s emphasis on sovereign clouds[\[24\]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=As%20AI%20permeates%20all%20aspects,benefit%20their%20businesses%20and%20regions) implies a bank should decide regional deployment needs early. Likewise, IBM’s and Snowflake’s announcements (not shown) about future AI governance standards suggest monitoring the field before over-investing in unproven tools.

| **1\. Target user** (core dev vs low-code vs no-code) | **AWS AgentCore:** Developers/AI engineers (framework-agnostic SDK)[\[3\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=real,can%20accelerate%20agents%20to%20production)[\[1\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIta%C3%BA%20has%20pioneered%20using%20AI%2FML,%E2%80%9C). &lt;br&gt; **Accenture Distiller:** Developers (enterprise SDKs for multi-agent solutions)[\[8\]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=query%20transformation%20for%20agentic%20RAG%2C,operations%2C%20scalability%2C%20and%20accelerated%20innovation). &lt;br&gt; **Snowflake Cortex:** Data/analytics teams (SQL-savvy analysts implementing Cortex AISQL and agents)[\[5\]](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=Cortex%20Agents%20orchestrate%20across%20both,applications%20grounded%20in%20enterprise%20data). &lt;br&gt; **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** Business/line-of-business users (low-code agent builder)[\[6\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio#:~:text=The%20platform%27s%20low,people%20without%20extensive%20technical%20backgrounds)[\[7\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio#:~:text=You%20can%20easily%20create%20agents,you%20might%20use%20agents%20include). &lt;br&gt; **Open-Source:** Core developers/ML engineers. |
| **2\. Flexibility for ISV agents** | **AWS AgentCore:** Very high – supports any agent framework or model, enabling reuse of third-party agents[\[3\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=real,can%20accelerate%20agents%20to%20production). &lt;br&gt; **Accenture:** Very high – “seamlessly integrates with any existing library of agents”[\[8\]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=query%20transformation%20for%20agentic%20RAG%2C,operations%2C%20scalability%2C%20and%20accelerated%20innovation) for reuse and multi-agent setups. &lt;br&gt; **Snowflake:** High – built-in Agentic Native Apps and Knowledge Extensions let banks install third-party agent modules inside Snowflake’s secure perimeter[\[9\]](https://www.snowflake.com/en/news/press-releases/snowflake-marketplace-adds-agentic-products-and-ai-ready-data-from-leading-news-research-and-market-data-providers/#:~:text=Agentic%20Native%20Apps%20are%20interoperable,monetize%20their%20Agentic%20Native%20Apps). &lt;br&gt; **Microsoft:** Limited – oriented to Microsoft ecosystem; can connect APIs but not a marketplace for external agents. &lt;br&gt; **Open-Source:** Maximum – free to import/adapt any third-party agent code (subject to internal vetting). |
| **3\. Platform ops model (self vs managed)** | **AWS AgentCore:** Fully managed by AWS (SaaS)[\[10\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Faster%20time%20to%20value); no on-prem option. &lt;br&gt; **Snowflake Cortex:** Fully managed SaaS (customers use Snowflake Data Cloud). &lt;br&gt; **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** Fully managed (Azure/M365 service). &lt;br&gt; **Accenture Distiller/Refinery:** Flexible – can be self-hosted (on-prem, cloud, sovereign) or delivered as a managed service by Accenture[\[11\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=Leveraging%20NVIDIA%20AI%20Enterprise%20software%2C,specific%20requirements). &lt;br&gt; **Open-Source:** Self-managed by bank (on-premises or cloud). |
| **4\. Modularity (infra, models, knowledge, agents, observability/governance)** | **AWS:** Highly modular – separate services for Runtime (compute), Gateway (tools), Memory, Identity, Observability, etc.[\[12\]](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/#:~:text=Runtime%20Deploy%20agents%20on%20secure%2C,running%20tasks.%20Learn%20more). Enables swapping layers (e.g. custom memory stores, models). &lt;br&gt; **Accenture:** Modular stack – covers distinct layers (model training, memory, orchestration, governance/observability)[\[13\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=The%20distiller%20framework%20encapsulates%20what,platform%20interoperability). AI Refinery even structures **Agents, Knowledge, Models, Governance** separately[\[15\]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=Agents). &lt;br&gt; **Snowflake:** Partially modular – splits structured (Analyst) vs unstructured (Search) analysis, plus knowledge extensions. All run inside the Snowflake Cloud, limiting infra modularity but unifying governance. &lt;br&gt; **Microsoft:** Less modular – one integrated agent builder. Plugins allow data connections[\[16\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20standout%20features,sophisticated%20logic%2C%20ensuring%20that%20their), but core model/infra choices are abstracted by Azure. &lt;br&gt; **Open-Source:** Fully modular – bank selects each layer (choose any infra, any LLM, any memory/db, any observability). |
| **5\. Update cadence and process** | **Continuous/Iterative:** Banks should review models and components frequently (e.g. quarterly or per major vendor update). **Platforms support monitoring:** Snowflake Agents recommend “monitor and iterate… continuously monitoring and refining governance controls”[\[17\]](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents#:~:text=4,while%20maintaining%20security%20and%20compliance). **Governance:** Adopt a controlled update process with re-validation (per NIST/ISO guidance)[\[19\]](https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/the-ai-governance-frontier-series-part-1-decoding-global-and-u-s-6a9d0781ba80#:~:text=regularly%20update%20your%20AI%20models,gov). Automate observability (AWS CloudWatch, Snowflake TruLens) and track performance/bias. **Compliance:** Tie updates to regulatory or data changes.

| **6\. Decisions now vs later** | **Decide Now:** Core architecture (cloud vs on-prem, identity/integration), data residency requirements (sovereign/cloud region)[\[11\]](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-launches-distiller-agentic-ai-framework-to-accelerate-scalable-industry-ai-solutions#:~:text=Leveraging%20NVIDIA%20AI%20Enterprise%20software%2C,specific%20requirements)[\[24\]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/ai-refinery#:~:text=As%20AI%20permeates%20all%20aspects,benefit%20their%20businesses%20and%20regions), vendor/platform choice, initial security/governance policies. &lt;br&gt; **Decide Later:** Specific LLM models and versions, advanced agent modules or third-party tools (until proven), fine-grained workflow designs. For example, determine agent framework and data-connectors now; defer choice of multi-agent orchestration complexity or experimental features until pilot succeeds. Platforms like Snowflake and AWS are evolving – banks can leverage new modules as they mature rather than locking in too early. |
