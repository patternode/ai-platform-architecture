# Agentic Platform Strategic Questions

## Overview
This document captures key strategic questions that need to be addressed as part of the agentic AI platform strategy and design process. These questions are critical for defining the platform architecture, governance model, and operational approach.

## Strategic Questions

### 1. Target User Definition
**Who is the target user for the agentic platform i.e. core developer, NC/LC**

This question addresses the primary persona and skill level of platform users, which will significantly impact:
- Platform complexity and abstraction levels
- User interface design and tooling requirements
- Documentation and training needs
- Support model requirements

### 2. Agent Reusability and Flexibility
**How much flexibility is desired for the reuse of ISV developed agents**

This question explores the balance between standardisation and customisation:
- Integration standards for third-party agent components
- Configuration vs customisation capabilities
- Licensing and commercial model implications
- Technical compatibility requirements

### 3. Long-term Platform Strategy
**What is the long-term strategy for platform (agent development, deployment) i.e. self managed or fully managed by Accenture**

This addresses fundamental operational and governance decisions:
- Build vs buy vs partner strategic approach
- Internal capability development requirements
- Vendor dependency and risk management
- Long-term cost and resource implications

### 4. Platform Modularity Design
**What is the ideal desired platform modularity within infrastructure, models, knowledge layer, agent & observability/governance**

This question defines the technical architecture approach:
- Component separation and integration patterns
- Scalability and flexibility requirements
- Technology stack decisions
- Observability and monitoring architecture

### 5. Component Evolution Process
**How often does the Bank intend to consider component choices within the platform and what is the process to update modules/services within the platform**

This addresses platform lifecycle management:
- Technology refresh cycles and processes
- Change management and impact assessment
- Testing and validation procedures
- Rollback and risk mitigation strategies

### 6. Decision-Making Timeline and Comfort Level
**Which platform/module/service decisions are you comfortable making now vs later**

This question prioritises immediate vs future decisions:
- Critical path dependencies for platform development
- Risk tolerance for early vs delayed decisions
- Resource allocation and timeline planning
- Minimum viable platform (MVP) scope definition

## Strategic Implications

These questions collectively address several key dimensions of the agentic platform strategy:

- **User Experience**: Questions 1 and 2 focus on who will use the platform and how
- **Operational Model**: Questions 3 and 5 address how the platform will be managed and evolved
- **Technical Architecture**: Question 4 defines the fundamental technical approach
- **Implementation Planning**: Question 6 addresses sequencing and prioritisation

## Next Steps

The answers to these questions should inform:
1. Platform architecture design decisions
2. Vendor selection and partnership strategies
3. Internal capability development plans
4. Implementation roadmap and milestones
5. Governance framework design
6. Risk management and mitigation strategies
