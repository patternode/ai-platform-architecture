Provide a detailed and comprehensive report on the main frameworks for developing multi-agent AI systems and agentic workflows. Specifically include Strands Agents, LangChain, LangGraph, and AutoGen but include all mainstream frameworks. Do a comparison of core similarities and key differences. Detail supported development languages. Provide a section describing a canonical agentic framework called "xAgentFramework" that has all of the characteristics of actual agentic frameworks. Document as an architecture pattern, describing each canonical component, and connections between components. Document the boundary between components created using the framework and external or runtime components provided in a canonical agentic platform (called "xAgentPlatform") that are required for an application built with the framework to actually run. Provide a list of common real-world use cases that would typically use xAgentFramework and xAgentPlatform. For each use-case provide enough detail to make it easy to create sequence diagrams, e.g. describe the steps in the use case. Provide a detailed report on mainstream agentic platforms that can be used as the xAgentPlatform. Specifically include AWS Bedrock AgentCore, Databricks Mosaic AI Agent Framework with Mlflow, Azure AI Foundry / Co-pilot Studio and AgentForce by Salesforce. As with xAgentPlatform, document canonical architectural layers, capabilities, components and connections.
