Undertake comprehensive research on best practices for the design of copilot studio enablement for the enterprise. Also include the design of an operating model that would enable self-service by business users of AI products i.e. agents that they can create themselves without needing help from technology. Include the guardrails and controls under which that should happen in order to minimise risk. Research should cover aspects such as governance, security, risk management, user training, and support structures including technology. Draw analogies from data platforms whereby the Technology team provides the platform and the business users self-serve within that platform under defined controls to create their own data products. In the case of copilot studio, the products would ab AI products as agents. Provide a taxonomy of AI products drawing analogies from data products.

The specific industry is banking for a regional sized bank.

The particular platform is Microsoft Copilot Studio.

The intended scale of the deployment is global enterprise-wide rollout.

We are looking for primarily best-practice frameworks and theoretical models. Reference real-world case studies if available.

Provide research findings with references in a structured format suitable for inclusion in an enterprise architecture document.

The research does not need to emphasize any specific banking regulatory frameworks.

As a maturity starting point, we you designing for a greenfield implementation for AI.

Please provide a single comprehensive document covering all areas.
