## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Vague Benefits**: Quantify with $ values or % improvements
2. **Technology-First**: Start with business problem, not tech solution
3. **Unrealistic Timelines**: Include discovery, pilot, rollout (not just build)
4. **Missing Change Management**: Allocate 10-15% of budget
5. **No Governance Plan**: Include from day 1, not afterthought
6. **No Comparable Examples**: Build credibility with industry benchmarks

See full list in **Guide Section: Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
