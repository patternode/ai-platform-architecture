## Cross-Cutting Insights

### 1. GenAI vs. Traditional ML

**2025 Reality**: Most high-value banking use cases use **hybrid approaches**:
- **GenAI**: Content generation, summarization, conversational interfaces, code generation
- **Traditional ML**: Fraud detection, credit scoring, risk modeling, forecasting

**Example**: Credit risk uses ML (XGBoost) for scoring + GenAI for memo generation.

### 2. Explainability is Mandatory

**Regulatory Requirement**: Financial services must explain AI decisions (GDPR, Model Risk Management)

**Technologies**:
- **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

**Application**: Every credit decision, fraud alert, or risk score must be explainable to regulators and customers.

### 3. Real-Time is the New Standard

**2025 Expectation**: Batch processing is outdated; customers expect real-time responses

**Examples**:
- Credit decisions: **Minutes** (not days)
- Fraud detection: **200-300 milliseconds**
- Customer queries: **Immediate** (conversational AI)
- Personalization: **Event-driven** (real-time triggers)

### 4. Agentic AI is the 2025 Breakthrough

**Definition**: AI agents that work autonomously without explicit human prompting

**Banking Applications**:
- Relationship managers: AI agents gather data, synthesize insights, generate account plans
- Fraud investigation: AI agents collect evidence across systems, summarize patterns
- Credit underwriting: AI agents extract financial data, calculate ratios, draft memos

**Performance**: **2-3x qualified leads**, **30-50% time savings** in early pilots

### 5. Multi-Agent Systems Are Emerging

**2025 Trend**: Complex workflows use multiple specialized AI agents working together

**Example**: Procurement ([UC-018](use-cases/UC-018/UC-018-Procurement-v1.0.0.md))
- Sourcing agent: Find suppliers
- Negotiation agent: Optimize pricing
- Risk agent: Assess supplier risk
- Invoice agent: Match and reconcile

**Rationale**: Single general-purpose agents underperform vs. specialized agent teams for complex tasks.
