### Gate 3: Backlog → Planned

**Criteria:**
- [ ] WSJF score calculated

## Stage Regression

Use cases may move backwards if:
- Dependencies become blocked
- Resources are reallocated
- Strategic priorities change
- Technical blockers emerge

All regressions must be documented in quarterly decisions.
