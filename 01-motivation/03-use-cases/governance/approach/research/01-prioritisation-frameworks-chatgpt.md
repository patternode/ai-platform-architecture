# Prioritization Frameworks for AI/ML Use Cases in Enterprise IT (2025)

Enterprise IT leaders in 2025 have a range of frameworks to evaluate and prioritize AI/ML use cases. With many potential AI initiatives available, these frameworks help organizations assess which use cases to pursue first and how to schedule them for implementation[\[1\]](https://www.forrester.com/report/scale-ai-value-with-the-use-case-selection-framework/RES181304#:~:text=To%20realize%20the%20revenue%20and,strategy%20for%20generating%20measurable%20outcomes). The focus is on general (industry-agnostic) frameworks that align with agile practices (such as SAFe) and support building a strategic AI roadmap. Below, we outline the **best frameworks** for prioritizing AI/ML use cases, describing each framework’s methodology for evaluation and scheduling, and how it supports managing AI/ML initiatives in an enterprise setting.

## Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) – SAFe’s Prioritization Method

WSJF is a core prioritization model in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) used to rank backlog items (features, epics, or AI use cases) based on relative value and effort[\[2\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=Weighted%20Shortest%20Job%20First%20,lesser%20value%20and%20longer%20duration). It works by computing a **WSJF score = Cost of Delay / Job Size**[\[3\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=Calculating%20WSJF%20is%20about%20considering,The%20formula%20is%20simple). **Cost of Delay (CoD)** is an aggregate of three factors[\[4\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=This%20metric%20consists%20of%20three,elements):

- *User/Business Value:* How much benefit or value the use case would deliver to customers or the business.
- *Time Criticality:* How urgent the use case is (e.g. regulatory deadlines or competitive timing).
- *Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement:* Whether implementing the use case reduces future risk or enables new opportunities.

The **Job Size** (or duration) is an estimate of effort or time required[\[5\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=Step%202%3A%20Calculate%20the%20job,duration%20or%20size). After scoring, use cases with the highest WSJF (high value, low effort) are tackled first[\[6\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=,Duration%3A%203%20months%20WSJF%3A%20500)[\[7\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=CoD%3A%2014000%20USD%20%2F%20month,Duration%3A%204%20months%20WSJF%3A%203500). This ensures teams deliver maximum ROI in the shortest time[\[2\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=Weighted%20Shortest%20Job%20First%20,lesser%20value%20and%20longer%20duration). In practice, **WSJF supports scheduling** by continuously reprioritizing the AI use case backlog so that the highest WSJF items are pulled into the next Program Increment or sprint[\[8\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=From%20the%20above%20calculations%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,2%2C%20and%20finally%2C%20feature%201)[\[9\]](https://fibery.io/blog/product-management/wsjf/#:~:text=3,valuable%20tasks%20are%20completed%20first). This agile approach aligns AI initiatives with business value, avoids waste, and accelerates delivery of impactful AI solutions.

## Impact/Effort Quadrant (Quick Wins Matrix)

A common framework for AI use case prioritization is the **Impact vs. Effort quadrant**, which plots each use case’s **business value (impact)** against the **effort** required. OpenAI’s enterprise teams, for example, use this simple quadrant framework to score AI use cases by their value to the company and the effort to implement[\[10\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Our%20customer%20success%20teams%20use,and%20scaling%20AI%20use%20cases). The result is a visual segmentation of use cases into four categories[\[11\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Impact%2Feffort%20framework%20High%20ROI%20focus,Moderna%E2%80%99s%20Dose%20GPT%20or%20Klarna%E2%80%99s):

- **High Impact, Low Effort (“Quick Wins”):** Use cases with strong ROI and relatively easy implementation. These are ideal starting points to **build momentum** and show early value[\[11\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Impact%2Feffort%20framework%20High%20ROI%20focus,Moderna%E2%80%99s%20Dose%20GPT%20or%20Klarna%E2%80%99s). Enterprises schedule these first to demonstrate success quickly.
- **High Impact, High Effort:** Strategic, transformative use cases (e.g. an AI-powered customer service agent) that can deliver significant value but require substantial time and resources[\[12\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=valuable%20across%20teams.%20High,But%20new%20products%20and)[\[13\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=High,build%20and%20deploy%2C%20so%20be). Often organizations **defer these to later phases**, after quick wins, using the quick-win successes to justify and inform the investment in these larger initiatives[\[12\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=valuable%20across%20teams.%20High,But%20new%20products%20and)[\[14\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=customer%20assistant,be%20open%20to%20promoting%20them).
- **Low Impact, Low Effort (“Self-Service” or minor cases):** Small improvements that individuals or single teams might implement for convenience[\[15\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=High%20ROI%20focus%20Quick%20wins,individual%20solutions%2C%20but%20often%20become). These typically are not enterprise program priorities but can be done ad-hoc without major scheduling impact.
- **Low Impact, High Effort:** Use cases that are hard to execute and yield minimal value. These are usually **de-prioritized or put on hold**[\[16\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=investing%20in%20higher,and%20scaling%20AI%20use%20cases) (they might be revisited if new tools or business changes increase their feasibility or value).

By focusing first on “quick wins,” this framework supports effective scheduling of AI projects – teams implement easy, high-value use cases in early iterations, then tackle more complex projects in later cycles. This approach ensures early successes (to gain buy-in) while still keeping an eye on bigger, long-term AI opportunities[\[12\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=valuable%20across%20teams.%20High,But%20new%20products%20and)[\[14\]](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/identifying-and-scaling-ai-use-cases.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=customer%20assistant,be%20open%20to%20promoting%20them). It aligns well with agile principles: deliver value early and often, and use feedback from quick wins to guide subsequent AI development.

## Business Value vs. Feasibility Matrix (Value–Feasibility Framework)

Another widely used framework evaluates AI use cases on **two dimensions: potential business value and feasibility** (or ease of implementation). Many organizations and consultancies recommend this approach as it aligns AI efforts with strategic ROI while considering practical constraints[\[17\]](https://www.pwc.be/en/news-publications/2025/future-of-AI.html#:~:text=3,to%20implement%20with%20existing%20technology). Google Cloud’s AI strategy playbook, for instance, uses a matrix plotting **expected value generation** vs. **actionability/feasibility** of each AI use case[\[18\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=When%20prioritizing%20gen%20AI%20use,feasibility%20of%20that%20use%20case). This approach incorporates multiple evaluation criteria[\[19\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Business%20Value)[\[20\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=,drive%20value%20for%20our%20organization):

- **Business Value:** Estimated impact on revenue, cost savings, customer experience, or other key metrics. *Questions:* Does the use case “move the needle” on important objectives? Does it align with top business priorities? Can its outputs be reused or scaled to other areas?[\[21\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Business%20Value)
- **Actionability:** How ready and adoptable the solution is. *Questions:* Is the organization able to act on the AI outputs? How easily can the use case be integrated into existing processes? How quickly could it start delivering value?[\[22\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Actionability)
- **Feasibility:** The technical and data considerations. *Questions:* Is AI the right fit for this problem? Is the necessary data available and reliable? What is the level of technical complexity, and are there any significant risks or regulatory concerns?[\[20\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=,drive%20value%20for%20our%20organization)

Using these criteria, teams score or map use cases to identify those with **high value and high feasibility** (top priorities), versus those that are valuable but not yet feasible (candidates for later, pending better data or capabilities), and those that are feasible but low value (which may be dropped). This structured scoring translates into an **actionable AI roadmap**: high-value, readily feasible use cases are implemented first, while high-value but complex projects might be scheduled for subsequent phases after groundwork is laid[\[23\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Using%20our%20matrix%2C%20we%20helped,and%20time%20to%20realize%20value)[\[24\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=As%20a%20second%20priority%2C%20the,ability%20to%20realize%20value%20quickly). For example, Google Cloud describes helping a client prioritize an AI-powered contact center (high value, quick to implement), while deferring more complex AI projects (high value but requiring more integration and data prep) to a second phase[\[23\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Using%20our%20matrix%2C%20we%20helped,and%20time%20to%20realize%20value)[\[24\]](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-build-an-effective-ai-strategy?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=As%20a%20second%20priority%2C%20the,ability%20to%20realize%20value%20quickly). Consultancies like PwC echo this approach: *“Prioritise your use cases based on impact and feasibility: focus on initiatives with significant ROI that align with strategy and resources”*[\[17\]](https://www.pwc.be/en/news-publications/2025/future-of-AI.html#:~:text=3,to%20implement%20with%20existing%20technology). Overall, the value–feasibility framework ensures that an enterprise’s AI initiatives are both **impactful and attainable**, and it sequences implementation in a way that maximizes benefits while minimizing execution risk.

## Gartner’s AI Opportunity Radar

Gartner’s **AI Opportunity Radar** is a strategic framework introduced in 2025 to help enterprises map out and prioritize AI use case opportunities as part of their overall AI ambition[\[25\]](https://enterpriseaiexecutive.ai/p/12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Gartner%20,commit%20to%20use%20case%20opportunities). It encourages C-level leaders to define where AI can have the biggest impact for the organization and then plan a portfolio of initiatives to capture that value[\[26\]](https://www.deepset.ai/guides/gartner-ai-opportunity-radar#:~:text=According%20to%20Gartner%2C%C2%A0%E2%80%9CGenAI%20value%20creation,challenges%2C%20goals%20and%20strategic%20imperatives). The radar framework guides executives to **explore potential use cases across the business, evaluate their feasibility and impact, and commit to a focused set of opportunities**[\[25\]](https://enterpriseaiexecutive.ai/p/12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=Gartner%20,commit%20to%20use%20case%20opportunities).

In practice, the AI Opportunity Radar facilitates workshops or strategy sessions where leaders plot AI use cases in terms of their *transformational potential and alignment with business goals*, often considering time horizons. For example, it might categorize AI initiatives into short-term wins, mid-term strategic bets, and long-term moonshots, ensuring a balanced AI project portfolio. Crucially, Gartner emphasizes that after identifying opportunities, organizations must **operationalize and schedule them via a coordinated AI roadmap** – *“AI investments should be directed by an AI strategy, with execution planned, coordinated, and orchestrated through an AI roadmap”*[\[27\]](https://www.deepset.ai/guides/gartner-ai-opportunity-radar#:~:text=The%20investments%20needed%20for%20their,orchestrated%20through%20an%20AI%20roadmap). This means the radar not only helps choose the right use cases but also integrates with **enterprise planning (e.g. product roadmaps or SAFe portfolio backlogs)** to time those initiatives appropriately. By using the AI Opportunity Radar, enterprise IT programs can maintain a clear line of sight from high-level AI ambitions down to scheduled implementations, ensuring that AI development is aligned with strategic priorities and staged for success.

## Forrester’s AI Use Case Selection Framework

Industry analysts at Forrester Research have also published a **Use Case Selection Framework** to help enterprises build a strategic AI/ML portfolio[\[1\]](https://www.forrester.com/report/scale-ai-value-with-the-use-case-selection-framework/RES181304#:~:text=To%20realize%20the%20revenue%20and,strategy%20for%20generating%20measurable%20outcomes). Forrester’s guidance (2024–2025) underscores the need for a **structured, collaborative process** in vetting AI use cases. With many ideas on the table, the framework’s goal is to filter these into a set of initiatives that deliver both immediate wins and long-term value[\[1\]](https://www.forrester.com/report/scale-ai-value-with-the-use-case-selection-framework/RES181304#:~:text=To%20realize%20the%20revenue%20and,strategy%20for%20generating%20measurable%20outcomes). Key aspects of Forrester’s framework include:

- **Cross-functional Evaluation:** Involvement of business stakeholders, data scientists, IT, and governance/risk experts in assessing each proposed AI use case[\[28\]](https://www.forrester.com/report/scale-ai-value-with-the-use-case-selection-framework/RES181304#:~:text=possible%20use%20cases%20for%20AI%2C,strategy%20for%20generating%20measurable%20outcomes). This ensures that use cases are not only technically feasible but also solve real business problems and meet compliance or ethical standards.
- **Proof of Value & Outcomes:** Emphasis on defining measurable outcomes for each use case (e.g. KPIs, success criteria) and possibly conducting small proofs-of-concept to validate value before full commitment[\[1\]](https://www.forrester.com/report/scale-ai-value-with-the-use-case-selection-framework/RES181304#:~:text=To%20realize%20the%20revenue%20and,strategy%20for%20generating%20measurable%20outcomes). Use cases that demonstrate clear business value and align with enterprise strategy get higher priority.
- **Prioritization Criteria:** Forrester recommends criteria such as expected ROI, strategic alignment, complexity, data readiness, and risk, similar to other frameworks. These criteria feed into a scoring or ranking mechanism to compare use cases.
- **Portfolio Roadmapping:** The selected use cases are then sequenced into a **roadmap** – for instance, quick-win projects (with manageable scope and fast ROI) first, while bigger projects might be slated for later phases once foundational capabilities or data are in place. The framework helps balance short-term gains with longer-term strategic AI development.

By using Forrester’s selection framework, enterprises can transform a “crowded field of proposed AI use cases” into a **focused portfolio of AI initiatives**[\[1\]](https://www.forrester.com/report/scale-ai-value-with-the-use-case-selection-framework/RES181304#:~:text=To%20realize%20the%20revenue%20and,strategy%20for%20generating%20measurable%20outcomes). This structured approach supports management of AI/ML programs by ensuring each project is justified, resourced, and timed in line with the organization’s capacity and strategic goals (very much in harmony with Lean Portfolio Management principles in SAFe).

## BCG’s AI Opportunity Assessment (Automation & ROI Focus)

Leading consultancies have developed their own prioritization models. **Boston Consulting Group (BCG)** offers a framework for assessing AI use cases by quantifying their *automation potential and cost impact*. In a 2025 BCG publication, the firm outlined how it evaluates generative AI opportunities by analyzing **which tasks can be automated and how much cost reduction or efficiency gain is achievable**[\[29\]](https://enterpriseaiexecutive.ai/p/12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=BCG%20,automatability%2C%20and%20cost%20reduction%20potential). This approach often involves: identifying processes or functions where AI could substitute or augment human work, estimating the percentage of task automation possible, and calculating the financial impact (savings or revenue uplift). Use cases that rate high on automatability and cost reduction tend to be top priorities for implementation[\[30\]](https://enterpriseaiexecutive.ai/p/12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=BCG%20,automatability%2C%20and%20cost%20reduction%20potential).

BCG’s framework supports enterprise AI program planning by highlighting the **“low-hanging fruit” in cost savings**. For example, if an AI system can automate a routine process and save millions annually, that use case would be prioritized early in the roadmap. Meanwhile, use cases with unclear automation benefits or minimal cost impact might be dropped or scheduled for later exploration. By focusing on tangible ROI and efficiency gains, BCG’s method aligns AI projects with business value and helps executives justify investments. It also dovetails with agile planning – high-ROI use cases can be quickly piloted and scaled, delivering financial benefits that can fund subsequent, more exploratory AI initiatives.

## Deloitte’s Agentic AI Prioritization (Differentiability Index)

Deloitte has introduced a prioritization framework tailored for “agentic AI” use cases (AI systems that act autonomously). A distinctive element of Deloitte’s framework is the **“Differentiability Index”** – a metric that measures *how essential or unique AI is to solving a particular problem*[\[31\]](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone1/in/en/docs/services/engineering-ai-data/2025/in-eaid-agentic-ai-pov-chapter-1.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDifferentiability%20index%2C%E2%80%9D%20which%20enables%20enterprises,or%20complexity%20is%20crucial%20for). In other words, it asks: *Does this use case significantly benefit from AI (versus a conventional solution), and will it differentiate the business?* This index is added as a factor alongside the more traditional measures of impact and ease of implementation[\[32\]](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone1/in/en/docs/services/engineering-ai-data/2025/in-eaid-agentic-ai-pov-chapter-1.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=match%20at%20L250%20prioritisation%20framework,AI%20as%20a%20core%20driver).

In practice, Deloitte’s method scores AI opportunities on **three dimensions: impact, ease of implementation, and differentiability**[\[32\]](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone1/in/en/docs/services/engineering-ai-data/2025/in-eaid-agentic-ai-pov-chapter-1.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=match%20at%20L250%20prioritisation%20framework,AI%20as%20a%20core%20driver). This forms an extended evaluation matrix where a high score means the use case is high-impact, relatively easy to execute, **and** highly reliant on AI’s unique capabilities. Use cases with a **high Differentiability Index** – where AI would provide a core competitive advantage or enable something not otherwise possible – are given priority, especially if they also have strong business impact[\[33\]](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone1/in/en/docs/services/engineering-ai-data/2025/in-eaid-agentic-ai-pov-chapter-1.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=match%20at%20L368%20%E2%80%9CDifferentiability%20Index%E2%80%9D,initiatives%20that%20offer%20high%20differentiability). On the other hand, an AI use case that could be done just as well with traditional software (low differentiability) might be ranked lower even if it has some business value, to ensure focus on initiatives where AI truly adds new value[\[34\]](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone1/in/en/docs/services/engineering-ai-data/2025/in-eaid-agentic-ai-pov-chapter-1.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDifferentiability%20Index%E2%80%9D%20acts%20as%20a,initiatives%20that%20offer%20high%20differentiability).

From a scheduling perspective, Deloitte’s framework helps organizations **sequence AI projects that offer unique strategic differentiation**. High-impact, high-differentiability use cases may be pursued first or in parallel with quick wins, as they can become flagship projects demonstrating AI’s transformative potential for the company. By avoiding “me-too” use cases and concentrating on those where AI is a game-changer, enterprises can better allocate resources and accelerate time-to-value where it counts most[\[35\]](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone1/in/en/docs/services/engineering-ai-data/2025/in-eaid-agentic-ai-pov-chapter-1.pdf?utm_source=enterpriseaiexecutive.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=prioritisation%20framework%20adds%20a%20unique,AI%20as%20a%20core%20driver). This approach supports management by aligning AI investments with the company’s unique strengths and strategic priorities, much in the spirit of SAFe’s emphasis on strategic alignment and economic prioritization.

## KPMG’s AI Investment Scorecard (Cost-Benefit Analysis)

KPMG’s framework for AI use case prioritization takes a **financial and resource-oriented view** to guide decision-making[\[36\]](https://enterpriseaiexecutive.ai/p/12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=KPMG%20,making). In 2025, KPMG developed an “AI investment assessment” model that factors in all key inputs and expected outcomes of an AI initiative. This includes the **full cost of implementation** – e.g. required hardware (infrastructure or cloud costs), software or licenses, and manpower (talent and training) – weighed against the **projected benefits or ROI** of the use case[\[36\]](https://enterpriseaiexecutive.ai/p/12-ai-use-case-prioritization-frameworks#:~:text=KPMG%20,making). By quantifying these elements, the framework produces a sort of score or business case for each AI use case.

Use cases can then be ranked by **ROI or net present value**, ensuring those with the best return for the investment are prioritized. For example, an AI project requiring heavy upfront investment in new infrastructure might be deprioritized unless it promises very large business gains, whereas a moderate-cost project with a clear, quick payoff would rise to the top. This approach supports scheduling by aligning AI projects with budget cycles and resource availability. High-scoring projects (strong benefits relative to cost) can be scheduled in the near term and fast-tracked, while lower-scoring ones might be scheduled later or reconsidered.

Importantly, KPMG’s holistic assessment helps **manage the AI project portfolio within enterprise constraints**: it ensures that chosen use cases are not only valuable but also **realistic given the organization’s capabilities and funding**. This prevents over-committing to too many high-cost AI experiments at once. Instead, it paves a feasible implementation roadmap where investments in AI are sequenced and scaled in step with the organization’s capacity to absorb costs and realize benefits.

## Supporting Effective AI/ML Portfolio Management

All of the above frameworks share a common goal: to help enterprises systematically **identify, evaluate, and schedule AI/ML use cases** so that resources are invested in initiatives with the highest strategic value. They bring transparency and rigor to the decision process, which is critical given the hype and plethora of AI opportunities. In an enterprise IT strategy context, these frameworks support **alignment, scheduling, and governance** in several ways:

- **Strategic Alignment:** Frameworks like Gartner’s Radar or EY’s three-pillar model ensure AI use cases link to business objectives and have executive buy-in[\[37\]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/cro-risk/ai-use-case-management#:~:text=)[\[26\]](https://www.deepset.ai/guides/gartner-ai-opportunity-radar#:~:text=According%20to%20Gartner%2C%C2%A0%E2%80%9CGenAI%20value%20creation,challenges%2C%20goals%20and%20strategic%20imperatives). This prevents chasing AI for AI’s sake and keeps the portfolio focused on what matters for the enterprise.
- **Value Focus:** Almost every framework (WSJF, impact/effort, value-feasibility, ROI models) centers on delivering business value fast. This ensures AI projects earn their keep – whether via cost savings, revenue, or competitive advantage – which is essential for sustaining support and funding[\[1\]](https://www.forrester.com/report/scale-ai-value-with-the-use-case-selection-framework/RES181304#:~:text=To%20realize%20the%20revenue%20and,strategy%20for%20generating%20measurable%20outcomes).
- **Feasibility & Risk Management:** By evaluating feasibility, data readiness, and risks (technical, ethical, or regulatory), these frameworks help avoid launching projects that are likely to stall. They incorporate risk mitigation and often include governance checkpoints (for example, EY’s framework embeds risk and responsible AI considerations from the start)[\[38\]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/cro-risk/ai-use-case-management#:~:text=,adoption%20while%20maximizing%20business%20value)[\[39\]](https://www.ey.com/en_us/cro-risk/ai-use-case-management#:~:text=By%20strengthening%20the%20connection%20between,business%20goals%20and%20regulatory%20expectations).
- **Phased Roadmapping:** The outcome of using these frameworks is typically a **phased implementation plan**. Quick wins and foundational projects are scheduled in the short term (e.g. current quarter or PI), building momentum and capabilities. More complex or speculative projects are slotted in later, with gates for reassessment. This incremental scheduling aligns well with agile program increments and rolling planning in SAFe, enabling adaptability.

In summary, enterprise IT programs in 2025 can choose from several proven frameworks to prioritize AI/ML use cases. Whether leveraging SAFe’s WSJF for agile delivery, a value-feasibility matrix for strategic clarity, or analyst/consultant models for portfolio-level planning, the key is to apply a consistent evaluation mechanism. This ensures that AI/ML initiatives are not only chosen wisely but also **sequenced for implementation in a way that maximizes impact** while managing risk and resource constraints. By using these frameworks, organizations can confidently integrate AI projects into their strategic roadmap and scale AI/ML adoption in an orderly, value-driven manner[\[1\]](https://www.forrester.com/report/scale-ai-value-with-the-use-case-selection-framework/RES181304#:~:text=To%20realize%20the%20revenue%20and,strategy%20for%20generating%20measurable%20outcomes)[\[27\]](https://www.deepset.ai/guides/gartner-ai-opportunity-radar#:~:text=The%20investments%20needed%20for%20their,orchestrated%20through%20an%20AI%20roadmap).
