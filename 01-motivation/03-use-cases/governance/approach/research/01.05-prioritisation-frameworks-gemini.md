# **2025 Frameworks for Prioritizing and Scheduling Use Cases in Enterprise IT Programmes**

## **I. Executive Summary: The 2025 IT Program Prioritization Mandate**

The prioritization landscape for large-scale IT programmes in 2025 mandates a significant evolution beyond traditional Return on Investment (ROI) methodologies. The core requirement is the adoption of comprehensive Weighted Scoring Models (WSMs) that explicitly integrate non-financial strategic drivers, particularly **Risk Mitigation (Cybersecurity)** and **Opportunity Enablement (AI and Data Foundation)**.1 This shift ensures that portfolio decisions align with critical business and regulatory imperatives rather than solely focusing on short-term revenue gains.

The **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)** model, standardized within the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), stands as the definitive enterprise standard for sequencing work items. WSJF provides a mathematical mechanism designed to maximize economic flow by prioritizing items with the highest Cost of Delay relative to their Job Size.3 Its unique structure incorporates the quantification of strategic risk and enabling architecture, providing robust justification for foundational investments.4

However, prioritization is only the initial stage; successful implementation and predictable delivery rely entirely on rigorous **Dependency Management** and disciplined **Capacity Allocation**.5 This essential integration is formalized through cadence-based events, such as Program Increment (PI) Planning, which acts as the operational bridge between the theoretically prioritized backlog and the resource-constrained implementation schedule.7 Organizations must view the scheduling process as a structured commitment, not merely an estimated timeline.

## **II. Strategic Context: IT Portfolio Prioritization in the 2025 Enterprise**

### **2.1. Defining the Programmatic Challenge: Scaling Value Delivery**

Large-scale IT programmes face the inherent challenge of scaling value delivery across multiple, often interdependent, teams and initiatives. Prioritization frameworks are vital methodologies that provide a consistent set of principles and strategies, moving decision-making from subjective guesswork to informed, objective selection.8 In complex environments, reliance on instinct can lead to misalignment and resource waste.

For enterprises operating at scale, prioritization frameworks are crucial for aligning cross-functional teams and ensuring the effective management of limited financial and human resources.8 A structured approach to prioritization is a governance imperative, preventing communication breakdowns, eliminating duplicative efforts caused by departmental silos, and, most importantly, ensuring that high-severity risks are detected and mitigated systematically.9 The framework must operate consistently across the Portfolio, Program, and Team levels to maintain strategic coherence.10

### **2.2. Critical Trends Shaping 2025 Prioritization: Strategic Investment Drivers**

IT investment prioritization in 2025 must actively respond to several dominant strategic trends. These include Cloud optimization, focus on Customer experience, strengthened Cybersecurity, building Data and AI foundations, and enabling Intelligent industry initiatives.2 These themes demand that IT programmes allocate dedicated resources toward non-traditional feature work.

A crucial prerequisite step for planning involves identifying and scoping a portfolio of high-potential AI/ML use cases through a full value-chain exploration.11 This requires proactive input from business leaders and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to rigorously define both the problem tractability and the potential economic value of these foundational efforts.11

Furthermore, Cybersecurity has escalated from a basic functional necessity to a core business imperative, demanding specific investment as a dedicated investment theme.12 The integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) is now essential for establishing resilient, adaptive security postures, enhancing threat detection, automating incident response, and proactively countering sophisticated threats like ransomware and zero-day attacks.12 Use cases focusing on AI/ML security solutions must be prioritized within the IT program backlog to safeguard sensitive data and maintain trust.12

### **2.3. The Prioritization Imperative: Moving from Intuition to Objectivity**

Prioritization frameworks establish a "shared language" across the organization, which is necessary to guide complex cross-functional discussions.14 By providing clear scoring rules and consistently weighing value against effort, these models enable objective, data-driven decisions that replace subjective hunches.14

At the highest organizational level, strategic direction is driven by the board's documented risk tolerance.9 This high-level governance sets the essential tone for all lower-level priorities. Frameworks like WSJF enforce this by structurally incorporating Strategic Themes into the quantitative scoring criteria, ensuring that resource allocation aligns directly with the established risk appetite and long-term business goals.9

## **III. Deep Dive: Quantitative Frameworks for Value Maximization**

### **3.1. The Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) Model (SAFe): The Enterprise Standard**

WSJF is the established sequencing tool within the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), primarily utilized to prioritize Epics, Capabilities, and Features.3 The core principle of WSJF is to maximize economic value delivered over time by calculating the ratio: Cost of Delay divided by Job Size or Duration.3 Initiatives resulting in the highest calculated ratio receive the highest priority, ensuring the organization maximizes the flow of value.4

#### **3.1.1. Deconstructing Cost of Delay (CoD)**

The Cost of Delay calculation is structured to force alignment on economic flow by incorporating three explicit, non-revenue-based components into a single relative score 1:

1. **User-Business Value:** This measures the fundamental value of the work item to the end-user or the business outcome.1  
2. **Time Criticality:** This factor quantifies the urgency of the work item, particularly critical for fixed regulatory deadlines, market opportunities that are time-perishable, or contractual obligations.1  
3. **Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement (RR/OE):** This strategic component measures the work item's potential for mitigating future operational risks (e.g., addressing the fragility of a legacy system, improving cybersecurity) or enabling future high-value initiatives (e.g., laying the foundation for a new Cloud or AI platform).1

#### **3.1.2. Prioritizing Smaller Jobs**

The denominator, Job Size or Duration, is essential for increasing organizational flow.1 By dividing the Cost of Delay by the Job Size, the model inherently prioritizes smaller, faster work items over larger, more time-consuming efforts, provided the value is comparable.1 This mechanism optimizes the queue size and accelerates feedback cycles.

#### **3.1.3. WSJF as the Essential Risk and Enabler Justification Tool**

The design of WSJF is specifically engineered to address the persistent challenge of underfunding crucial, non-feature work, often known as Enablers (e.g., architectural runway, security hardening).10 Standard business value metrics, such as simple ROI, often fail to justify these necessary investments. WSJF resolves this structural flaw by mandating that **Risk Reduction** (reducing the likelihood or impact of system fragility or a cyber breach 15) and **Opportunity Enablement** (building the Cloud or AI platform 2) are quantitatively scored and included in the numerator.1 This mechanism mathematically forces the prioritization of foundational, strategic work alongside customer-facing features, thereby ensuring the long-term technical health, compliance, and strategic viability of the IT programme.4

For practical application at scale, SAFe typically advocates using relative estimating for scoring both CoD (the sum of the three components) and Duration.4 This relies on relative numbers (e.g., Modified Fibonacci sequence) rather than demanding complex, time-consuming financial valuations for every backlog item, allowing the process to scale across many Agile Release Trains (ARTs).4

### **3.2. Weighted Scoring Models (WSM): Adaptability and Custom Criteria**

A Weighted Scoring Model (WSM) offers a highly flexible and transparent alternative, or complementary tool, to WSJF.16 WSM is particularly useful for large enterprises with diverse product portfolios where strategic focus shifts frequently, as it allows for structured evaluation based on custom criteria and relative weights.16

#### **3.2.1. The Six-Step Implementation Guide for WSM**

Implementing a WSM provides a structured, objective, and transparent prioritization process 16:

1. **Define the Criteria:** Cross-functional collaboration is required to define the factors that genuinely drive value, such as Customer Impact, Technical Feasibility, Strategic Fit, and Revenue Potential.16  
2. **Assign Weights:** Relative weights (percentages) must be assigned to reflect the strategic priority of each criterion, with the total summing to 100%.16 This step is critical for aligning the model with strategic goals and addressing internal competition for resources.16  
3. **Score Options:** Each use case or initiative is rated against every criterion using a consistent scale (e.g., 1-10).16 To minimize bias, scores should ideally be based on defined scoring guidelines and data-backed reasoning.16  
4. **Calculate Weighted Scores:** The calculated score for each criterion is multiplied by its assigned weight, and the results are summed to generate the total weighted score for the initiative.16  
5. **Analyze and Prioritize:** Initiatives are ranked by their final weighted score. The highest-scoring options align with the company's goals, though final ordering must account for dependencies and necessary trade-offs.16  
6. **Review and Refine:** The model is a dynamic governance tool. Criteria and weights must be regularly reassessed and adjusted to reflect evolving market conditions, customer needs, and strategic shifts, ensuring the model remains actionable and relevant.16

#### **3.2.2. WSM as the Portfolio Investment Steering Mechanism**

While WSJF standardizes sequencing, WSM allows Portfolio leadership to exercise precise, top-down strategic governance. The model's strength lies in its ability to manipulate weights to enforce macro-level organizational mandates. For example, during a critical regulatory deadline or a major cybersecurity initiative, the EPMO can strategically assign a higher weight (e.g., 40%) to the **Risk Mitigation** criterion and a lower weight (e.g., 20%) to **Business Value**.16 This structural manipulation immediately skews resource allocation toward the organization’s most pressing macro-economic or regulatory needs, irrespective of an individual project's immediate profitability.16 This ensures compliance with organizational strategic themes, which are often tracked using tags or custom fields within enterprise tools like Azure Boards.10

### **3.3. RICE and DRICE: Enhancing Product-Centric Prioritization**

The RICE framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) is a standard methodology that helps product teams gauge feasibility and justify decisions to stakeholders.8 However, for large IT programs involving foundational or complex efforts, RICE can be time-consuming to apply if data validation is required from multiple sources, and the lack of consistent metrics can lead to subjective or misleading results.8

The DRICE model enhances RICE by integrating a revenue focus and specific readiness checks.14 DRICE requires teams to move from simple relative scoring to explicit financial estimates (e.g., quantifying the "$X of expected revenue") and focuses on selecting items that are "shovel-ready".18 This framework is highly valuable for data-focused teams and product initiatives where revenue measurement is clear and requires a high degree of confidence in delivery.14

## **IV. Integrating Strategic and Qualitative Factors**

### **4.1. The Kano Model: Defining Customer Value and Functional Baseline**

The Kano Model provides a critical customer-centric lens for prioritization. Developed by Dr. Noriaki Kano, this model classifies features based on their impact on customer satisfaction, typically separating them into **Must-Haves** (basic expectations), **Performance** (satisfaction is proportional to functionality), and **Excitement** (unexpected delight).19

A Kano analysis involves collecting valuable Voice of Customer (VoC) information.20 This qualitative data is essential for anchoring the **User-Business Value** component of quantitative models like WSJF or WSM.1

The analysis of Kano results creates a fundamental value floor for prioritization. When a feature is identified as a Must-Have 19, its non-delivery equates to massive customer dissatisfaction or market rejection (a high failure risk). Consequently, the Business Value component—and implicitly the Cost of Delay—for any Must-Have feature must be scored exceptionally high, regardless of its immediate revenue impact.20 Kano acts as a qualitative prerequisite check, ensuring that baseline user expectations are met before quantitative metrics are applied to maximize optional value.

### **4.2. Risk and Compliance Prioritization (RR/OE Deep Dive)**

Effective risk prioritization is the process of ranking potential threats based on criteria aligned with the organization's documented risk tolerance, ideally set at the board level.9 This continuous process helps organizations focus limited resources on the most significant threats, improving resource allocation and strengthening alignment between risk appetite and treatment strategies.15

The primary tool for this analysis is the **Risk Matrix** (or risk grid), which visually maps risks on a two-dimensional scale: likelihood versus the severity of the impact.15 This systematic analysis generates quantifiable scores necessary to inform the Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement (RR/OE) component in the WSJF or WSM models.

The strong connection between Cybersecurity and AI/ML is an increasingly vital component of the RR/OE metric. Given the continuous evolution of cyber threats, prioritizing IT use cases that integrate AI/ML to build adaptive, scalable security postures is a direct investment in risk mitigation.12 This focus on the Cybersecurity-AI nexus ensures compliance with regulatory standards and strengthens the organization's defense against sophisticated attacks.12

### **4.3. The Impact/Effort Matrix: Visualizing Quick Wins and Strategy**

The Impact/Effort Matrix, also known as the Value vs. Complexity/Effort graph, is a powerful visual tool for initial prioritization guidance.21 This methodology involves plotting initiatives on a graph where axes represent "Business Value" and "Complexity/Effort".21 It requires teams to quantify value, which must encompass benefits to both customers and the business's bottom line.23

The resulting quadrant analysis provides clear guidance for sequencing decisions 24:

* **Quick Wins (High Value, Low Effort):** These are the "no-brainers" and should be prioritized first to build momentum and deliver immediate value to users. Initiatives with the highest WSJF scores often fall into this quadrant.  
* **Major Projects (High Value, High Effort):** These represent strategic, long-term initiatives that promise massive returns but require significant investment.  
* **Fill-ins (Low Value, Low Effort):** Minor tasks or tweaks that can be addressed when the team has spare capacity or during lulls.  
* **Thankless Tasks (Low Value, High Effort):** These are considered "time sinks" and should be avoided at all costs.24

The Matrix is particularly effective for generating cross-functional alignment quickly before diving into complex quantitative scoring.14

**V. Operationalizing Scheduling: Connecting Priority to Implementation**

### **5.1. The Critical Role of Dependency Management**

Prioritization and scheduling are distinct disciplines. Prioritization determines *what* use cases are most valuable to the business; Dependency Management determines *when* those use cases can realistically be delivered based on technical sequence and resource availability.5

**Project Dependency Mapping** is a fundamental discipline for modern IT organizations.25 This process involves identifying, documenting, and managing interdependency relationships between different projects, tasks, teams, and resources.25 It is critical for ensuring effective planning, preventing operational bottlenecks, and reducing the risk of costly delivery delays.25

A crucial understanding for programme management is that dependency mapping serves as the hard constraint that transforms a theoretically ranked backlog into a realistic, sequenced implementation schedule. For example, if a use case achieves the highest WSJF score (indicating top priority) but requires a prerequisite database schema change delivered by a separate Agile Release Train (ART) in a later Program Increment (PI), the use case cannot be scheduled for implementation earlier.5 Ignoring dependencies, even for highly prioritized work, invariably leads to project failure and organizational waste.5

### **5.2. Scaling Implementation through Program Increments (PIs)**

In scaled agile environments, the implementation schedule is not arbitrarily pushed by a product owner; instead, the development team pulls work from the backlog as there is determined capacity (velocity) for it.6 This capacity-based pull ensures realistic planning, enabling teams to confidently state: "We have capacity for X amount of work, so we will deliver these Y highly prioritized items".26

The Scaled Agile approach structures delivery around the Program Increment (PI), which is a fixed cadence of 8 to 12 weeks.10 PI Planning is the required, cadence-based event that serves as the foundation for the implementation schedule, aligning all ART teams to a shared mission, vision, and set of collective outcomes for the upcoming PI.7

### **5.3. Managing Cross-Program Dependencies (ART Coordination)**

To manage alignment across multiple development trains (ARTs), enterprise tooling (such as Azure Boards) supports SAFe by mapping PIs and Sprints to shared **iteration paths** across the team hierarchy.10 This ensures all ARTs are planning against common release schedules.10

During PI Planning, the visualization of work on the **ART Planning Board** is a cornerstone activity.28 This board explicitly tracks cross-team dependencies and associated risks, enabling their identification, tracking, and management.28 By keeping this board alive beyond the planning event, it becomes a working artifact, preventing surprises mid-PI and helping teams plan more realistically.28 Teams finalize this process by defining and linking PI Objectives directly to their work items, digitally capturing confidence votes and commitments.7 While enterprise tools provide the hierarchical structure (Epics to Features mapped to PIs) and shared iterations 10, custom configurations or specialized features are often necessary to manage and track complex *cross-ART dependencies* for scheduling in real-time throughout the PI cycle.10

Table 2: Suggested Weighted Criteria for 2025 IT Program Prioritization (Illustrative WSM Example)

| Criterion Category | Weight (%) | WSJF Component Alignment | Calculation/Definition | 2025 Strategic Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **I. Business Value & Growth** | 35% | User-Business Value 1 | Quantified expected revenue, operational efficiency gains, or market competitive advantage. | Focus on customer-first experience and AI-driven efficiency.2 |
| **II. Time & Regulatory Urgency** | 25% | Time Criticality 1 | Hard deadlines (e.g., regulatory compliance, contract expiration, time-sensitive revenue window). | Prioritizing features that meet non-negotiable legal/financial deadlines. |
| **III. Risk Mitigation & Enablement** | 20% | RR/OE 1 | Reduction of system fragility, mitigation of critical cybersecurity risks, or foundational readiness for AI/Cloud.4 | Cybersecurity resilience and building architectural runway (Enablers).13 |
| **IV. Implementation Complexity** | 20% | Job Size (Inverse) 3 | Resource consumption, technical effort, and dependencies (low complexity scores higher). | Ensuring feasibility and maximizing throughput by favoring shorter jobs.1 |

**VI. Governance and Continuous Portfolio Alignment**

### **6.1. Roadmapping as a Dynamic Artifact**

For an IT program to remain relevant in a dynamic business environment, its roadmap must be treated as a living document, not a static plan.29 Effective governance requires establishing a regular, disciplined cadence, such as a quarterly review, to assess progress, incorporate feedback, and strategically reprioritize initiatives based on emerging business conditions and stakeholder input.22 This continuous improvement approach recognizes that requirements and scheduling needs evolve constantly.29 Reprioritization is immediately necessary if certain features are found to be taking longer than initially expected, forcing the team to monitor progress continuously.22

### **6.2. Stakeholder Alignment and Transparency**

A well-managed and transparent backlog, formalized through consistent prioritization scoring (WSJF or WSM), serves as a critical communication tool. It ensures that all stakeholders and teams are aligned and focused on the most critical, high-value tasks.6 The structured nature of quantitative frameworks facilitates productive cross-functional collaboration by requiring all teams—including product managers, engineers, and designers—to align on the criteria and their relative importance, which inherently fosters trust and transparency in decision-making.16

### **6.3. Measuring Success and Feedback Loops**

The final phase of the governance process involves defining clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and success metrics to measure the impact and effectiveness of the implemented enhancements.29 This continuous feedback mechanism is essential. By comparing the projected value (based on the initial prioritization score) against the actual delivered impact, organizations can validate their initial prioritization assumptions and inform the continuous refinement of the criteria and weights used for future prioritization cycles.16

**VII. Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations**

The successful management of large IT programmes in 2025 demands a unified approach that seamlessly connects strategic portfolio prioritization with operational scheduling. The reliance on purely financial or subjective methods is no longer adequate for managing complexity and emerging risks.

**Key Recommendations for IT Program Leadership:**

1. **Mandate Quantitative Prioritization (WSJF/WSM):** The organization should standardize on the **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)** model for sequencing features and capabilities across Agile Release Trains. Alternatively, a highly customized **Weighted Scoring Model (WSM)** should be implemented at the Portfolio level, allowing the organization to impose custom strategic weights to actively steer investment toward non-negotiable mandates such as regulatory compliance, cybersecurity hardening, and foundational AI architecture.4  
2. **Explicitly Quantify Strategic Risk:** All prioritization models must explicitly integrate and score the value of **Risk Reduction** and **Opportunity Enablement (RR/OE)**.1 This ensures that critical investments in cybersecurity (especially AI/ML-driven threat mitigation 12) and architectural enablers (Cloud/Data foundation 2) receive justifiable priority over short-term revenue features alone.  
3. **Institutionalize Dependency Management:** Project Dependency Mapping must be formalized as a non-negotiable step in the workflow, occurring between prioritization (ranking) and scheduling (commitment).5 This function prevents the scheduling of high-value use cases that lack necessary prerequisites, ensuring efficient resource utilization and avoiding organizational bottlenecks.  
4. **Enforce Cadence-Based Scheduling (PI Planning):** The implementation schedule must be governed by the fixed cadence of the Program Increment (PI). PI Planning should be mandated as the operational event where capacity is allocated, dependencies are visualized (e.g., using the ART Planning Board), and cross-ART teams make firm, transparent commitments (PI Objectives) on delivery.7 This ensures that the prioritized backlog translates into predictable, attainable delivery outcomes.
